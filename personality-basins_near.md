# Personality Basins - Near Blog (Summary)

> Personality basins are the mental model that I use to reason about humans within their environment. They are an elucidating way to think about many concepts: from modelling why people are they way they are, how they change over time, how mental illnesses and addiction function along with how we should look for their cures, and how the attention economy optimizes itself to consume all of your free time.

### Personality Basins: Understanding Human Behavior
**What is Personality?**
- Set of traits formed through interaction with environment
- Individuals modify their personality based on successful experiences

**The Process:**
1. Born with a set of traits in given environment
2. Interact with environment and learn what works/doesn't work
3. Adjust behavior to optimize outcomes
4. End up in a "basin" reflecting successful patterns

**Personality Basins**
- Visualization of successful personalities
- Black line = individual's personality over time
- Lower points = more successful personalities

**Unconscious Changes:**
- Most changes occur outside conscious awareness
- Techniques like nonviolent communication help with introspection and observation

**Addictive Behaviors:**
- Often start without notice until addiction sets in
- Environmental factors play a role in shaping preferences

**Questioning Personality Traits:**
- Ask "why am I this way?" and "could I be different?"
- Conscious experience influenced by personality, environment, and stimuli

**Finding the Right Basin:**
1. Try out new basins to see how they feel
2. Test optimality through full RLHF process (depth vs breadth)
3. Perform less exploration as you progress in life

**Adversarial Personality Space:**
- Other agents want different things from you
- Concept of "Personality Capture" when environment modifies your RLHF to benefit themselves
- Symbiotic equilibria exist for mutually beneficial feedback loops.

### Personality Capture: Understanding Its Impact and How to Escape It

**What is Personality Capture?**
- The phenomenon where external forces try to shape or control an individual's personality
- Often driven by incentives for approval or cheering from crowds
- Can destroy a person's mind and soul if taken too far

**Examples of Personality Capture:**
- Social media platforms trying to keep users engaged all day long
- Children becoming captivated by games like Minecraft or Roblox, often against their will
- Employers asking for hard work and dedication from employees

**Environment and Learning Rate:**
- Changing environment can lead you to discover new optimal versions of yourself
- Moving cities, trying new things, meeting different people are some ways to change environment
- High-magnitude experiences, like trauma or falling in love, provide large gradient updates for personality development

**Overcoming Personality Capture:**
1. Change your environment: expose yourself to new situations and people
2. Increase learning rate by trying new things consistently
3. Experiencing high-magnitude events can lead to quicker changes in personality
4. Be aware that some experiences may have high variance, both positive and negative outcomes are possible
5. Understanding the benefits of overcoming personality capture is crucial for long term antifragility.

### Personality Basins and Mental Illnesses

**Personality Basins**:
- Model of mental illnesses
- Allows for simple planning to solve problems
- Determines personality traits (introversion, humor, music preferences)
- Also curates which psychiatric conditions affect an individual

**Escaping Personality Basins**:
- Difficult due to large gradient updates required
- Can be induced by strong positive stimuli like drugs
- More commonly achieved through small and continual updates over time (e.g., CBT)

**Drug Addictions**:
- Drugs "personality-capture" the individual into a deep basin
- Gradual tapering off dosage provides small gradient updates
- Relapsing is equivalent to falling back into the bottom of the basin

**Societal Personality Basins**:
- Societies have their own hyperdimensional personality basins
- Can be influenced by memetic information
- Two ways to move out of societal basin: gradual updates or a strong update

**Modeling Multiple Personality States**:
- Personality is more dynamic than a static point
- Can model personality using multiple dimensions (e.g., family, friends, co-workers)
- Sub-basins can represent different moods and actions

**Related Topics**:
- Signal theory, control theory, set point theory, game theory, reinforcement learning, deep learning
