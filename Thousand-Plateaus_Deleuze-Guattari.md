# A Thousand Plateaus
by Gilles Deleuze (Author), Felix Guattari (Author)

> A Thousand Plateaus continues the work Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari began in Anti-Oedipus and has now become established as one of the classic studies of the development of critical theory in the late twentieth century. It occupies an important place at the center of the debate reassessing the works of Freud and Marx, advancing an approach that is neither Freudian nor Marxist but which learns from both to find an entirely new and radical path. It presents an attempt to pioneer a variety of social and psychological analyses free of the philosophical encumbrances criticized by postmodern writers. A Thousand Plateaus is an essential text for feminists, literary theorists, social scientists, philosophers, and others interested in the problems of contemporary Western culture.  - [A Thousand Plateaus (Amazon)](https://www.amazon.com/Thousand-Plateaus-Capitalism-Schizophrenia/dp/0816614024/?&tag=cognitivetech-20)

## A Thousand Plateaus

**The Two Books on Capitalism and Schizophrenia**
- This book is the companion volume to **Anti-Oedipus**, written together by two authors
- The authors used pseudonyms to remain unrecognizable, but kept their own names out of habit
- They aimed to make themselves "unrecognizable" and "render imperceptible" what makes them act, feel, and think
- The books are composed not of chapters, but "plateaus," which may be read independently, except the conclusion
- The authors explain why they used this format later in the text

**The Nature of a Book**
- A book has no object or subject, it is made up of various materials and different dates and speeds
- Attributing the book to a subject overlooks its "working of matters" and "exteriority of their relations"
- Books contain "lines of articulation or segmentarity, strata and territories," as well as "lines of flight, movements of deterritorialization and destratification"
- The relative rates of flow on these lines produce phenomena of slowness, viscosity, acceleration, and rupture
- An assemblage is the unit of measure for a book's content
- Writing itself has no meaning or signification, it only measures something else

**The Types of Books**
- A "root-book" is the classical, organic, subjective interiority of the tree or root image
- Binary logic and biunivocal relationships dominate this type of book, which has not understood multiplicity
- The "radicle-system," or fascicular root, is a modern figure of the book where the principal root has aborted
- Natural reality destroys the principal root, but its unity subsists as past or yet to come

---

### Connections, Heterogeneity, and Multiplicity

**Theories on Unity and Multiplicity**
- **Reflexive spiritual reality**: compensates for lack of unity in the world by demanding a more comprehensive or extensive totality
- Examples: William Burroughs' cut-up method, Joyce's words, Nietzsche's aphorisms
- These methods affirm a higher unity in the subject while thwarting unity in the object
- The world has become chaotic, but books represent a "radicle-chaosmos" rather than a "root-cosmos"

**Rhizome as a Concept**
- A **rhizome**: subterranean stem that is different from roots and radicles
- Includes both positive (e.g., potatoes, tubers) and negative (e.g., couchgrass, weeds) elements
- Characteristics of the rhizome:
  1. Principle of connection and heterogeneity: any part can connect to anything else
  2. Principle of multiplicity: the multiple ceases to relate to the One as subject or object when treated as a substantive
  3. Rhizomes expose arborescent (tree-like) pseudomultiplicities for what they are

**Language and Communication**
- Linguistic trees on the Chomsky model are too abstract, not reaching the "abstract machine" that connects language to semantic and pragmatic contents
- A rhizome establishes connections between semiotic chains, power structures, and circumstances in various fields (arts, sciences, social struggles)
- No ideal speaker-listener or homogeneous linguistic community; language is essentially heterogeneous
- Breaking down a language into structural elements is not a method for the people, while a rhizomatic approach can analyze language by decentering it onto other dimensions and registers

**Conclusion**
- The world has become chaotic, but books represent a "radicle-chaosmos" rather than a "root-cosmos"

### A Rhizomatic Perspective

**Multiplicities and Rhizomes**

**Characteristics of Multiplicities:**
- No points or positions, only lines
- Lines of flight or deterritorialization
- Flat and asignifying
- Defined by the outside: abstract line or plane of consistency

**Rhizome vs. Structure:**
- Rhizome allows no overcoding
- Contains lines of segmentarity (stratified, territorialized) and deterritorialization (lines of flight)
- Ruptures occur when segmentary lines explode into a line of flight

**Examples:**
- Ants: form an animal rhizome that can rebound after being destroyed
- Orchid and wasp: deterritorialize and reterritorialize on each other, forming a rhizome

**Implications:**
- Dualism or dichotomy is relative and connected
- Movements of deterritorialization and processes of reterritorialization interlink and form relays in a circulation of intensities
- Evolution may involve rhizomatic connections between different species rather than arborescent descent.

---

### Maps, Tracings, and Transformation

**Rhizome vs Tree Model**

**Characteristics of a Rhizome:**
- Not amenable to structural or generative models
- Oriented toward experimentation with the real
- Constructs the unconscious, fosters connections
- Open and connectable in all dimensions
- Detachable, reversible, susceptible to modification
- Multiple entryways and exit points
- Includes strata of unifications and totalizations
- Lines of flight may reproduce formations they intend to dismantle

**Comparison with Tree Logic:**
- Tracings are like leaves of a tree, linear and static
- Genetic axis and deep structure are infinitely reproducible principles of tracing
- Focuses on describing de facto states or maintaining intersubjective balance
- Limited to ready-made tracings, unable to construct the unconscious
- Confining every desire and statement to a genetic axis or overcoding structure
- Rejects pretraced destiny, whether named divine, anagogic, historical, economic, structural, hereditary, or syntagmatic.

**Map vs. Tracing:**
- Maps are open and connectable in all dimensions
- Multiple entryways and exit points
- Constructive instead of descriptive
- Includes phenomena of redundancy that can be like tracings
- Lines of flight may reproduce formations they intend to dismantle but opposite is true for tracing.

**Methodology:**
- Put the tracing back on the map for accuracy.

---

### Rhizomes and the Power of Intensive Traits

**The Dangers of Tracing**
- The tracing process transforms multiplicities into organized, stable images
- Reproduces only impasses, blockages, and points of structuration
- Examples: psychoanalysis and linguistics
  - Focus on reproducing "impure" aspects of the unconscious or language
  - Betrays the true nature of rhizomes (rhizome = desire's movement)

**Little Hans Case Study:**
- Child's cartography analyzed to understand how it was broken and obstructed
- Family photo projected onto unconscious maps
- Child made to take root in family, subjectified affects
- Professor Freud's intervention blocked escape routes, led to shame and guilt (becoming-horse)

**Importance of Studying the Unconscious:**
- Show how a child tries to build a rhizome, despite obstructions
- Resituate impasses on the map to open up possible lines of flight
- Deligny's method: combine maps for autistic children

**Various Map-Tracing Assemblages:**
- Tree/root structures in rhizomes and vice versa
- Intensive traits may challenge hegemony of signifier, create new connections
- Axons and dendrites form multiplicity in brain's neuroglia system

**Memory Differences:**
- Short-term memory: rhizome or diagram type (discontinuity, multiplicity)
- Long-term memory: arborescent and centralized (imprint, tracing)
- Short-term memory acts at a distance, under conditions of discontinuity.

---

### From Arborescent to Rhizomatic Systems

**Concepts:**
- Short-term memory vs long-term memory
- Arborescent systems (hierarchical) vs acentered systems (finite networks)
- Tree model vs rhizome model

**Short Term Memory:**
- Merges with nervous, temporal, and collective rhizome
- Includes forgetting as a process
- Short-term memory traces and translates but continues to act in it

**Long Term Memory:**
- Traces and translates long-term memories (family, race, society, or civilization)
- Memories continue to influence from a distance, offbeat, untimely way

**Arborescent Systems vs Acentered Systems:**
- Arborescent systems: hierarchical with centers of significance and subjectification, preestablished channels of transmission
- Acentered systems: finite networks where communication runs between any neighbor to any other, interchangeable individuals, no central agency required for synchronization

**Centered vs Acentered Calculation:**
- Both modes valid but undergo change in state when applied to things
- Psychoanalysis and linguistics examples given as tree model dominates Western thought and reality

**Differences Between East and West:**
- Agriculture: West - based on chosen lineage containing a large number of variable individuals, fields populated with seed plants; East - horticulture based on small number of individuals derived from a wide range of clones
- Moralities and philosophies: transcendence vs immanent ones
- Music and sexuality also differ between the two cultures.

**Tree Model vs Rhizome Model:**
- Tree model: dominant in Western reality, based on root-foundation, Grund or racine concept
- Rhizome model: opposes tree model in every respect, liberation of sexuality from reproduction and genitality.

---

### A Non-Dualistic Model of Connection and Transformation

**Characteristics of a Rhizome**
- Unlike trees or their roots: connects any point to any other point
- Traits not necessarily linked to traits of the same nature
- Brings into play very different regimes of signs, and even nonsign states
- Reducible neither to the One nor the multiple
- Not a multiple derived from the One or directly n, n+1
- Composed of dimensions, or directions in motion
- Has no beginning or end, but always a middle (milieu) from which it grows and which it overspills
- Constitutes linear multiplicities with n dimensions having neither subject nor object, which can be laid out on a plane of consistency
- Changes dimension, undergoes metamorphosis when it changes nature
- Unlike a structure: defined by a set of points and positions, with binary relations between the points and biunivocal relationships between the positions. The rhizome is made only of lines: lines of segmentarity and stratification as its dimensions, and the line of flight or deterritorialization as the maximum dimension after which the multiplicity undergoes metamorphosis.

#### "Exploring the Rhizomatic Nature of Thought and Expression"

**Rhizome vs Arborescent System:**
* Rhizome: antigenealogy, short-term memory, nonhierarchical system without a central automaton or organizing memory
* Operates by variation, expansion, conquest, capture, offshoots
* Composed of plateaus that communicate with one another across microfissures
* Can be read from anywhere and related to any other plateau
* Machinic assemblages of desire and collective assemblages of enunciation

**Characteristics of a Rhizome:**
* Multiplicity connected by superficial underground stems
* No signification, subjectivity, or unity in a traditional sense
* Acts on semiotic flows, material flows, and social flows simultaneously
* No tripartite division between reality, representation (book), and subjectivity (author)
* Establishes connections between multiplicities from each order without recapitulation

**Examples of Rhizomatic Writing:**
* Marcel Schwob's book on the Children's Crusades: multiplies narratives like so many plateaus with variable numbers of dimensions
* Andrzejewski's book, "Les portes du paradis": composed of a single uninterrupted sentence; a flow of children; semiotic flow of confessions; sexuality and desire
* Armand Farrachi's book on the Fourth Crusade, "La dislocation": sentences space themselves out and disperse or jostle together; typography begins to dance as the crusade grows more delirious.

**Challenges of Rhizomatic Thinking:**
* Difficulty in seeing things in the middle rather than from above or below
* Lack of successes in this area compared to traditional histories written from a sedentary point of view and in the name of a unitary State apparatus.

### Nomadism, Assemblages, and the War Machine

**Nomadism vs. Cultural Books**
- **Need for a more profound nomadism**: goes beyond Crusades' pivotal or aborted unity, seeks true nomads or those who no longer move
- **Books as cultural tracings**: trace themselves, previous books by the same author, other books, established concepts and words, world present, past, and future
- Even anticultural books may still carry heavy cultural loads: used actively for forgetting instead of remembering, underdevelopment instead of progress, nomadism over sedentarity
- **Rhizomatics = Pop Analysis**: even if people have other things to do besides read it, more pragmatic framework is better than tracing concepts

**State vs. War Machine**
- State pretends to be a world order, roots man
- War machine's relation to an outside is not another model; makes thought itself nomadic and the book a working part in every mobile machine

**Characteristics of Rhizome**
- No beginning or end, always in the middle between things
- Unique alliance, conjunction carries enough force to shake and uproot the verb "to be"
- Useless questions: where are you going? where are you coming from?
- Proceeding from the middle, through the middle, coming and going rather than starting and finishing
- American literature manifests rhizomatic direction to a greater extent, practices pragmatics

**Transversal Movement vs. Localizable Relation**
- Between things: not a localizable relation but a perpendicular direction, transversal movement that sweeps one and the other away
- Undermines its banks and picks up speed in the middle.

## 2. 1914: One or Several Wolves? Field of Tracks, or Wolf Line

**2. 1914: One or Several Wolves? Field of Tracks, or Wolf Line**

**The Wolf-Man's Second Episode**:
- The Wolf-Man rose from the couch tired, knowing Freud's tendency to brush up against truth but fill it with associations
- Freud understood only dogs and their tails, not wolves or anuses
- The Wolf-Man knew Freud would soon declare him cured, but his treatment would continue under Brunswick, Lacan, Leclaire
- The Wolf-Man was acquiring a proper name, "Wolf-Man," which he felt more singular than his own

**Freud's Clinical Discovery**:
- **Neurotics**: Able to compare and perceive objects globally as substitutes, but unable to grasp details like stitches on a sock
- **Psychotics**: Unable to make global comparisons, but can perceive multiplicity in details (e.g., comparing goosebumps to rhinoceros horns)
- Freud discovered the art of molecular multiplicities, but reverted to his familiar themes of father, penis, and vagina

**Freud's Reductive Procedure**:
- **Neurotics**: Comparisons and identifications guided by representations of things
- **Psychotics**: Representations of words, not the same unity as in neurotic discourse
- Freud tried to restore unity through the word, but this jeopardized proper names and the relation to multiplicity

**Freud's Treatment of Wolf Dream**:
- Freud asked how there were 6 or 7 wolves in a dream about only 5 or 6
- Associated the dream with "The Wolf and the Seven Kid-Goats," purging the wolf's multiplicity to represent coitus between parents
- Reduced the wolves to dogs, parents making love, or even their own castration

**Franny's Perspective on Becoming-Wolf**:
- Wolves watch intently, it is more reassuring to see dogs or parents in the act of making love
- The subject's position in relation to the wolf-multiplicity is important when joining or not joining the pack

### The Role of Bodies and Crowds in Schizophrenia

**Understanding Crowd Phenomena in the Unconscious:**

**Characteristics of Crowd Phenomena:**
- Swarming, teeming, fermenting
- Multiplicity of individuals in constant motion with unpredictable movements
- Demands high level of tension but brings violent happiness

**Schizos' Perspective:**
- Fully part of the crowd yet outside it
- Perpetual motion to keep up with crowd's unpredictable movements
- Sharp eyes and ears, able to distinguish buzz and shove of the crowd

**Freud vs. Schizos:**
- Freud mistook crowds for a single person
- Schizos see multiplicity in every aspect of life (pores, babies, rods, bees)

**Body Without Organs:**
- Opposed to organism's organization but teeming with life
- People, tribes, and racial origins adopted as adoptive family

**Multiplicities in Dreams:**
- Elements ceaselessly vary and alter their distances from one another
- Indivisible elements that cannot be increased or diminished without changing nature
- Intensive character of multiplicity's elements and relations between them

**Freud's Perspective:**
- Reduction to the One: subdivisions become substitutes for single Father or object.

**Proper Approach:**
- Understand multiplicities in intensity, not negation or lack
- Wolf is a pack, instantaneously apprehended as such in approach or move away from zero.

---

### Wolf Machines, Becoming-Wolf, and Intensive Multiplicities in Deleuze and Guattari's Thought

**The Wolf-Man's Body without Organs**
- Wolves designate intensity, threshold of intensity on body without organs
- Dentist identified violent bite and pustular gums in Wolf-Man
- Jaw as high intensity, teeth as low intensity, pustular gums approach zero
- Becoming wolf is not representation or substitution but intensities, speeds, temperatures

**The Wolf Machine vs. Anal Machine**
- Both express intensity: anus' approach to zero distance that cannot be decomposed
- Wolves and anus hold the same role on periphery of pack
- Jaw descends to anus, not wolf jaw, both form a multiplicity transformed

**Types of Multiplicity**
- Discrete vs. continuous
- Extensive or divisible (molar) vs. intensive or durational (molecular)
- Arborescent vs. rhizomatic
- Macro- vs. micromultiplicities

**Characteristics of Mass Multiplicity (Crowd)**
- Large quantity, divisibility and equality of members
- Concentration, sociability of aggregate as a whole
- One-way hierarchy, organization of territoriality or territorialization
- Emission of signs

**Characteristics of Pack Multiplicity**
- Small or restricted numbers
- Dispersion, nondecomposable variable distances
- Qualitative metamorphoses, inequalities as remainders or crossings
- Impossibility of fixed totalization or hierarchization
- Brownian variability in directions, lines of deterritorialization
- Projection of particles, each member alone even in company

**Recognizing the Schizo Position vs. Paranoid Position**
- In a pack: hold on by hand or foot, being at edge is part of deterritorialization line
- Social persons embedded in mass, securely near center, never at edge except duty.

---

### Machines, Molar and Molecular

**Key Concepts:**
* Multiplicities: molecular machines and molar machines
* Assemblage theory
* Psychoanalysis vs. Assemblage Theory
* Oedipus complex
* Kafka's work
* Love, depersonalization, and multiplicities

**Molecular Machines vs. Molar Machines:**
- Multiplicities of multiplicities forming a single assemblage
- Operate in the same assemblage: packs in masses and masses in packs
- No dualism between types

**Psychoanalysis vs. Assemblage Theory:**
- Flattens everything, ignoring molecular unconscious and molar machines
- Oedipus complex explanation is insufficient for understanding complex relationships between multiplicities

**Examples of Assemblages:**
- Wolf-Man's dream: Wall with closed door, empty dresser, big woman, wolves
  - Revolutionary mass (wolves) goes over to a large-scale social machine
- Love: Seizing someone in a mass, discovering their internal packs or multiplicities

**Components of Assemblages:**
- Human, social, and technical machines
- Organized molar machines
- Molecular machines with particles of becoming-inhuman
- Oedipal apparatuses (statements)
- Counter-Oedipal apparatuses

**Assemblage Theory in Action:**
- Every individual is caught up in an assemblage of libidinal and unconscious elements
- Reproduce its statements when speaking in own name.

---

### A Deeper Understanding of Libidinal Assemblages and Collective Agents in Psychoanalysis

**Freud's Approach to Psychology:**
* Focused on Oedipus Complex and castration as primary sources of neurosis
* Ignored multiplicity and collective agents of enunciation
* Limited understanding of libidinal assemblages, instead focusing on individual statements

**Critique of Freud:**
* Depersonalization of individuals in favor of machinic assemblages
* Importance of multiplicities and cleanliness (proprete) in understanding desire
* Lack of consideration for zoological perspective

**Freud's Misunderstanding of Multiplication:**
* Obsession with castration as the sole motor of neurosis
* Overlooking the significance of collective agents of enunciation and their impact on personal statements
* Inability to bring machinic assemblages to light

**Impact on Patients:**
* Deprivation from true basis for self-expression
* Silencing and prevention of individual statements
* False sense of cure through behavioral change or neutrality

**Case Study: The Wolf-Man**
* Kafka's story, Jackals and Arabs, offers multiple interpretations beyond Oedipus Complex
* Multiplication of jackals represents pack deterritorialization vs. mass territoriality
* Cleanliness (proprete) as a test for desert desire
* Misunderstood as castration by Freud

**Freud's Neutrality:**
* Preventing patients from speaking in their own names
* Silencing people and disregarding individual statements
* Focus on behavioral change instead of understanding multiplicities.

## 3. 10,000 B.C: The Geology of Morals (Who Does the Earth Think It Is?)

**The Geology of Morals (Who Does the Earth Think It Is?)**

**Double Articulation**:
- Professor Challenger's lecture on geology and biology
- Explained that the Earth (the Deterritorialized, the Glacial, the giant Molecule) is a body without organs
- This body is permeated by unformed, unstable matters, flows in all directions, free intensities or nomadic singularities, mad or transitory particles
- However, there is an important phenomenon: stratification
- Strata are layers, belts. They give form to matters, imprison intensities, lock singularities into systems of resonance and redundancy, produce molar aggregates
- Strata are acts of capture, like black holes or occlusions striving to seize whatever comes within their reach
- They operate by coding and territorialization on the Earth; they proceed simultaneously by code and by territoriality
- Challenger quoted a sentence from a geology textbook: "A surface of stratification is a more compact plane of consistency lying between two layers."
- Strata come at least in pairs, each with double articulation (Articulate twice, B-A, BA)
- **First Articulation**: Chooses or deducts unstable particle-flows to form metastable molecular or quasi-molecular units (substances), imposes statistical order (forms)
- **Second Articulation**: Establishes functional, compact, stable structures (forms), constructs molar compounds (substances)

**Organic Stratification**:
- The organism is a problem of articulation and the articulatory relation
- Organism "befalls" the body of the smith through a machinic assemblage that stratifies it
- **Morphogenesis**: Molecular realities are caught up in statistical aggregates, then organized into stable structures, form organs, functions, regulations, molar mechanisms, distribute centers
- **Cellular Chemistry**: Polymerization of units to form macromolecules; first stage forms temporary intermediaries, second stage constructs stable products

---

### Content, Expression, and the Net of Hjelmslev

**Concept of Double Articulation:**
- Operates at different levels: cellular chemistry, genetics, geology, linguistics, etc. (not constant)
- Involves two articulations and segmentarities
  - First operates through a series of reactions
  - Second repeats the same reaction
- Depends on genetic code and independent molecules: protein units and nucleic units
- Binary relations between units of same type, biunivocal relationships between different types
- Two articulations bring forms and substances into play (not constant distribution)

**Professor Challenger:**
- Claimed to have invented rhizomatics or stratoanalysis
- Cannot be clearly understood due to lack of specific goals, methods, or principles
- Pet student Young Professor Alasca tried defending but caused controversy
- Preferred to cite Danish Spinozist geologist Hjelmslev for explanation of net and strata

**Hjelmslev's Net:**
- Breaks with form-content duality by incorporating form of content and form of expression
- Not linguistic in scope or origin, but general characteristics of strata
- Matter: unformed, nonstratified body and its flows (subatomic particles, pure intensities)
- Content: formed matters chosen by substance and form
- Expression: functional structures organized by their specific form and compounds made of substances.

**Double Articulation vs. Molecular and Molar:**
- Sometimes coincides with molecular and molar; sometimes not
- No correspondence or conformity between content and expression, only isomorphism with reciprocal presupposition.

**Content and Expression:**
- Real distinction but relative terms (first and second articulation)
- Both vary from one stratum to another and intermingle within the same stratum
- Forms and substances of content play role of expression in relation to others; conversely for expression.

**Double Articulations:**
- Double pincers or binds everywhere on a stratum (multiple double articulations)
- Hjelmslev's warning: terms "expression plane" and "content plane" are arbitrary.

---

### Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire vs. Cuvier

**Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire's Concept of Stratification**

**Unity and Variety of a Stratum**:
- Matter, materials, substantial elements, and formal relations may be the same throughout a stratum
- However, molecules, substances, and forms are different from one another
- Unity of composition on each stratum is a single abstract entity or machine
- Organic stratum has specific unity but diverse organic forms and structures

**Dialogue with Cuvier**:
- Geoffroy proposed that organic forms can be transformed by "folding" one form into another
- Cuvir rebutted, stating that there are irreducible axes and branches in nature, not just degrees of development
- Baer argued that embryological development does not allow for interchange between types of forms
- Vialleton added that some processes only occur during embryonic development and cannot be observed in adults

**Folding and Forms**:
- Folding is a concept used by Geoffroy to describe the transformation of one form into another
- However, Cuvier argued that folding does not allow for going from one type of form to another
- Baer and Vialleton argued that embryological development does not provide evidence for such transformations

**Cuvier vs. Geoffroy**:
- Their differences reflect different philosophies: Cuvier was a rigid specialist focused on discontinuous changes, while Geoffroy thought in terms of topological spaces and smooth transformations
- This debate continues to be relevant today, with researchers studying the folding of the cerebral cortex and the concept of rhizomes.

---

### A New Coupling of Individuals and Milieus

**Key Contributions of Darwinism:**
- Transformation of forms: populations do not preexist, they are statistical results
- Reversal of embryogenesis and phylogenesis: phylogenesis has access to a range of relative forms
- Substitution of populations for types
- Substitution of rates or differential relations for degrees

**Unity and Diversity of a Single Stratum:**
- A stratum has a unity of composition: molecular materials, substantial elements, and formal relations or traits
- Materials are not the same as unformed matter; they come from substrata
- Elements and compounds constitute an interior, while materials are exterior but still part of the stratum
- Interior and exterior exchange places through exchanges and transformations in organization
- The limit between interior and exterior is defined by the membrane conveying formal relations.

**Ecumenon vs. Planomenon:**
- Ecumenon: unity of composition of a stratum, abstract machine enveloped by the stratum
- Planomenon: plane of consistency where exchanges and transformations occur.

---

### Epistrata, Parastrata, and the Evolution of Life

**The Concept of Epistrata and Parastrata in Biology**
- **Epistrata**: Intermediaries between exterior milieu and interior seed, multiple discontinuous states of metastability
- **Parastrata**: Formal relations or traits common to all strata assume entirely different forms at the level of the limit or membrane of the central belt
- **Stratum's Unity**: Exists only in its substantial epistrata and parastrata, not independently of a periphery that forms a new center and reacts back
- **Associated Milieus**: Not just interior or exterior, but annexed or associated with sources of energy different from alimentary materials
- **Milieu's Role**: Acts on entire organisms through selection; forms depend on autonomous codes sanctioned by the milieu
- **Parastrata and Populations**: Necessarily apply to populations, changes in code evaluated in relation to a molar population.

---

#### "The Interplay of Codes, Deterritorialization, and Territorialities in Biological Systems"

**Theories on Code, Decoding, and Deterritorialization:**
- Inseparability of code from decoding process: modern genetics demonstrates that codes include essential margins of decoding (supplements with free variation & transferable fragments)
- Forms relate to populations, codes, and decoding processes in the parastrata
- Physical particles and chemical substances undergo deterritorialization across strata, corresponding to more or less stable states
- Degrees of development are relative and functionally determined by differential speeds, relations, and rates

**Deterritorialization vs. Reterritorialization:**
- Positive power with degrees and thresholds (epistrata)
- Always relative and has reterritorialization as its complement
- Organisms deterritorialize internally while reterritorializing externally
- Every stratum operates by grasping intensive particles over which it spreads forms and substances

**Communication Between Codes, Territorialities, Deterritorialization:**
- No simple correspondence between codes and territories; they have the same subject in a stratum: populations
- Modifications of code influenced by exterior milieu, decide their selection based on interior milieus
- Every modification has an associated milieu, entails deterritorialization in relation to exterior and reterritorialization on interior milieus

**Animal World:**
- Constituted by signs that divide it into zones (shelter, hunting, neutrality)
- Milieus confront each other, animals preserve lines of flight to regain associated milieu when danger appears
- Flights are conquests and creations; territorialities are secondary, dependent on movements of deterritorialization and reterritorialization.

---

### The Interplay of Content and Expression in Relative and Absolute Deterritorialization

**Strata and Deterritorialization**

**Strata**:
- Strata are continually being shaken by phenomena of cracking and rupture at various levels (prebiotic soup, prechemical soup, accumulating epistrata, abutting parastrata)
- Relative movements between strata: accelerations and blockages, comparative speeds, differences in deterritorialization creating relative fields of reterritorialization.

**Deterritorialization**:
- **Absolute deterritorialization**: an absolute line of flight or drift that escapes spatiotemporal and existential coordinates, reaching the unformed state on the plane of consistency.
- **Relative deterritorializations**: stratic or interstratic movements between epistrata, parastrata, or singularities on the plane of consistency.

**Abstract Machines**:
- Abstract machines have two modes of existence: 
  - Enveloped in a specific stratum and regulating its relative deterritorializations
  - Cutting across all stratifications and developing on the plane of consistency, piloting flows of absolute deterritorialization.

**Absoluteness vs. Speed**:
- Absolute deterritorialization is not defined by speed alone.
- It can be achieved through phenomena of relative slowness or delay (e.g., retarded development).
- What qualifies a deterritorialization is its nature, whether it constitutes epistrata and parastrata with articulated segments or follows a nondecomposable line on the plane of consistency.

**Strata vs. Plane of Consistency**:
- Strata are always residue, not the opposite of absolute deterritorialization (the plane of consistency).
- The machinic assemblages between strata regulate differential relations and relative movements also have cutting edges of deterritorialization oriented toward the absolute.
- Plane of consistency is always immanent to the strata; both states coexist as different intensities.

---

### Expression and Content in Biology

**Formal Distinction Between Content and Expression:**
- Real distinction between content and expression due to distinct forms in a thing, not just observer's mind
- Formal distinction is special, only applying to one aggregate or subject (stratum)
- Examples: scales of magnitude, states, formal reasons, intermediary states, nucleic acids and proteins on the organic stratum
- Linearity of nucleic sequence leads to autonomous expression and reciprocal independence from content without accounting for orders of magnitude
- Consequences: organism's power to reproduce and deterritorialize, alignment of code or linearity of nucleic sequence, higher threshold of deterritorialization

**Organic Stratum:**
- Preserves relation between molecular and molar with all kinds of intermediate states
- Expression becomes independent in its own right, autonomous
- Linearity of expression instead of voluminous or superficial, unidimensional (nucleotides and nucleic acids)
- Invariance found in certain molecules without regard to order of magnitude
- Proteins also independent of nucleotides, only thing determined is sequence correspondence
- Derivative form of expression yields three-dimensional structures through folding back on protein sequence

**Third Major Grouping of Strata:**
- Alloplastic form of content brings about modifications in external world
- Linguistic form of expression operates with symbols comprehensible, transmittable, and modifiable from outside.

---

### Deterritorialization and Overcoding in the Hand, Language, and Technology

**Leroi-Gourhan's Analysis**
- Understanding of hand tool couple and face language distribution
- Hand as a "coding" (digital code), dynamic structuration, and formation (manual form)
- Extended in tools, which are active forms implying substances or formed matters
- Products serve as tools and organized into parastrata/epistrata
- Manual formal traits constitute stratum's unity of composition
- Synergistic deterritorializations of other organs (foot) and milieu (steppe vs forest)
- Correlative reterritorializations (foot, breast)
- Maps: organic, ecological, technological

**Language as New Form of Expression**
- Set of formal traits defining new expression in operation throughout the stratum
- Vocal substance involves larynx, mouth, and overall facial motricity
- Deterritorialization of snout (mouth), lips, nursing period for language learning
- Steppe milieu exerted strong pressures for selection: larynx development, vocal substance, articulation (soft speech)
- Genetic linearity vs. temporal linearity and overcoding in language expression
- Translation, translatability, and scientific conception of the world through language
- Independence of form of expression from substance: RNA to DNA chains translation possible
- Imperialist pretentions on behalf of language: every semiology must use medium of language.

**Formation of Power vs. Regime of Signs**
- Formations of power: much more than tools, determine and select agents in tool usage and communication
- Regimes of signs: much more than languages, constitute regimes that preexist them and operate differently from other strata.

---

### The Role of Signs and the Signifier

**Content vs Expression**
- Abstract Machine unfolds, producing an illusion exceeding all strata
- Distinction between content and expression is real but not illusory
- Content: technological, hand-tool relation; social Machine, formations of power
- Expression: symbolic, face-language relations; semiotic Machine, regimes of signs

**Cerebral-Nervous Milieu**
- Organic substratum not passive support
- Prehuman soup immersing us
- Hand and face create distinct pluridimensional languages

**Signs**
- Three types: indexes (territorial), symbols (deterritorialized), icons (reterritorialized)
- Signs only present when there's a distinction between forms of expression and content that is categorical
- Abstract machine develops on the plane of consistency and makes a categorical distinction between signs and particles

**Terminology**
- Expansive method dangerous, lays groundwork for imperialism of language
- Significance of signifier can overshadow the primacy of language over all strata.

---

### Beyond Signifier and Signified

**Theories of Language: Signifier-Signified Relationship**

**Characteristics of Signifier**:
- Redundancy and indistinguishability from signified
- Despotic and successful due to reduction of expression to the signifier
- Arbitrary, yet necessary for each other
- Ambivalent, with no conformity or correspondence between form of content and form of expression
- Relationship stands in radical opposition to the scenario of the signifier

**Form of Content vs. Form of Expression**:
- Each has its own history and segments
- Fitting them together requires a concrete assemblage taking their real distinction into account
- Signs are not signs of a thing, but mark a threshold crossed in deterritorialization and reterritorialization
- Signifiance designates only one specific regime among multiple regimes existing in the formalization of expression

**Limitations of Signifier**:
- Not reducible to signified or base-superstructure
- No primacy of content or expression can be established, as they are interdependent
- Economic content already has forms and expressions specific to it
- Relationship between form of content and form of expression is accomplished by the abstract machine and machinic assemblages.

---

#### "Understanding the Complexity of the Plane of Consistency and its Relationship with the Strata"

**Understanding the Strata and Plane of Consistency**

**The Strata and Pyramidal Image**
- Replacing parallelism with a pyramidal image: content, assemblages, regimes of signs, forms of expression, and ideology form a superstructure within a State apparatus.
- Language has a special place but exists only in heterogeneous regimes of signs.

**Misconstruing the Nature of Language, Regimes of Signs, Organizations of Power, and Content**
- Misconstrues nature of language as circulating information instead of distributing contradictory orders.
- Regimes of signs express organizations of power or assemblages; they don't have anything to do with ideology as an expression of content (ideology is obscuring social machines).
- Organizations of power are everywhere, effecting formalizations of content and expression; they're not within a State apparatus.
- Content isn't economic in the last instance; there are as many directly economic signs or expressions as noneconomic contents.

**Analyzing Social Formations: No Less or Higher Organization**
- Strata serve as substratum for each other without intermediaries.
- Industrial age defined by insects and bacteria.
- No lesser, no higher or lower organization; substratum is an integral part of the stratum, bound up with it as the milieu in which change occurs.

**The Plane of Consistency: Abolition of Metaphor**
- Disparate things and signs move on the plane of consistency: electrons, interactions, black holes, crystallizations...
- No difference between artificial and natural; distinction between contents and expressions, forms and formed substances exist only by means of and in relation to strata.
- Identifying and naming things without strata is impossible.

**Stratification vs. Destratified Plane of Consistency**
- Strata are animated and defined by relative speeds of deterritorialization; absolute deterritorialization exists from the beginning.
- Abstract machine develops on the plane of consistency, enveloped in each stratum whose unity it defines, and half-erected in certain strata.
- Continuum of intensities, combined emission of particles or signs-particles, conjunction of deterritorialized flows: these are factors proper to the plane of consistency.

**Abstract Machine vs. Concrete Machinic Assemblage**
- Abstract machine has different simultaneous states on the plane of consistency.
- Abstract machine develops upon the plane or remains enveloped in a stratum whose unity it defines.

---

#### "Understanding Machinic Assemblages and Their Role in the System of Strata"

**The Machinic Assemblage and the Abstract Machine**

**The Machinic Assemblage**:
- Performs coadaptations of content and expression
- Ensures biunivocal relationships between segments of content and expression
- Guides division of stratum into epistrata and parastrata
- Ensures relation to substratum and brings about corresponding changes in organization
- Effectuates the abstract machine on a particular stratum, between strata, and in the relation between strata and plane of consistency
- Necessary for organic stratum articulations, relations between strata, and organisms being caught within social fields

**The Mechanosphere**:
- Set of all abstract machines and machinic assemblages outside, on, or between strata
- System of the strata has nothing to do with signifier/signified, base/superstructure, mind/matter
- Reducing strata to a single stratum or closing system in on itself cuts off from plane of consistency as deterritorialization

**Summary of Notions**:
- **Body without Organs/Destratified Plane of Consistency**: singular, nonsegmented multiplicities composed of intensive continuums and emissions of particles-signs
- **Abstract Machine/Matter of the Plane**: constructs body or draws plane, lines of flight or absolute deterritorializations
- **System of the Strata**: strata fashion forms and form matters into substances, distinction between expressions and contents, units
- **Stratum Unity**: double articulation of content and expression, distinct and in a state of reciprocal presupposition

**Types of Real Distinction**:
- **Real-Formal**: realms of magnitude with resonance of expression (induction)
- **Real-Real**: different subjects with linearity of expression (transduction)
- **Real-Essential**: different attributes or categories with superlinearity of expression (translation)

**Stratum Unity vs. Parastrata/Epistrata**: divides into parastrata according to irreducible forms and associated milieus, and epistrata according to layers of formed substances and intermediary milieus

**Machinic Assemblage**: regulates relations between strata, contents and expressions on each stratum in conformity with the preceding divisions
- Borrow from different strata, appear disordered but function in different assemblages
- Metastratum, in touch with plane of consistency and effectuating abstract machine
- Located at intersection of contents/expressions on each stratum and all strata with plane of consistency
- Rotates in all directions like beacons

**Challenger's Departure**: deterritorializing and leaving for the "poison garden", panic as creation, no attempt to keep him from leaving.

### A Journey Through the Abnormal Clock

**Key Insights from Text:**

**The Figure's Odd Behavior**:
- Attempted to slip into an assemblage serving as a drum-gate
- Displayed odd posture scarcely human
- Curious, fascinated shuffle towards the coffin-shaped clock

**Figure's Interaction with Clock:**
- Reached the abnormal clock
- Blurred black claw fumbled with door
- Produced a queer, clicking sound
- Entered the coffin-shaped case and pulled shut after itself

**The Abnormal Clicking:**
- Continued to beat out a dark, cosmic rhythm
- Underlies all mystical gate-openings
- Represents the Mechanosphere or rhizosphere.

## 4. November 20, 1923—Postulates of Linguistics The Order-word Assemblage 
---

### I. Language Is Informational and Communicationai

**Language as Information and Communication**
- Language not for information, but for orders and obedience
- Teacher's commands are part of language system
- Order-words as elementary unit: statement or order given
- Indifference to credibility in announcements
- Fundamental forms of speech are commands, expressions of obedience, etc.
- Language functions as a map, not a tracing

**Order-Word and Its Significance**
- Coextensive with language as order-word is a function
- Not origin in nonlinguistic point but from saying to saying
- Narrative based on hearsay: transmitted orders
- Importance of indirect discourse

**Performative Sphere and Illocutionary Acts**
- Impossible to conceive language as code or communication of information
- Speech acts internal to language, impossible to define independently
- Pragmatics becomes presupposition behind all dimensions
- Difficulty in seeing speech acts/implicit presuppositions as coextensive with language.

---

##### "The Social Character of Enunciation and Collective Assemblages of Language"

**Benveniste's Perspective:**
- Performative: relates to self-referentiality of terms (I, YOU) rather than speech acts
- Language is communicational, not informational
- Subjectivity or intersubjectivity in language explains all other aspects

**Ducrot's Reversal:**
- Self-referentiality cannot account for the performative
- Performative explained by illocutionary, not self-reference
- Illocutionary explained by collective assemblages of enunciation

**Order-Words:**
- Not a particular category of explicit statements but relation to implicit presuppositions (speech acts)
- Every statement displays this link directly or indirectly
- Information and communication are subordinate to redundancy

**Redundancy:**
- Two forms: frequency and resonance
- Primary role in language, not just a limitative condition

**Collective Assemblages of Enunciation:**
- Intrinsically social character
- Individuation and subjectification depend on the nature and transmission of order-words within a social field
- Indirect discourse exemplifies collective assemblage, with no clear contours or individual subjects

**Importance:**
- Accounts for the social character of enunciation
- Necessary to demonstrate how enunciation implies collective assemblages
- Collective assemblage: redundant complex of act and statement that necessarily accomplishes it.

---

#### The Role of Order-Words and Pragmatics in Social Change

**The Incorporeal Transformation and Order-Words**

**Incorporeal Transformations**:
- Instantaneous and immediate
- Simultaneous with the effect they produce
- Recognizable by their instantaneousness and immediacy
- Expressed in statements, such as "I love you" or "All power to the Soviets"
- Can be attributed to bodies but are not corporeal themselves

**Order-Words**:
- Incorporeal transformations expressed through statements
- Designate a relation between statements and noncorporeal attributes they express
- Affect both the speaker's body and the recipient's body
- Can be attributed to specific circumstances, such as majority, retirement, or love
- Require credibility and power to be effective

**Variation in Circumstances**:
- Performative statements are not the same in different contexts
- Variables of expression internal to enunciation establish a relation between language and the outside
- Constants alone cannot explain how a word can be a complete enunciation

**Pragmatics**:
- Pragmatics is concerned with the variation of order-words and noncorporeal attributes linked to social bodies
- Transformational research examines how order-words affect immanent acts
- Lenin's "On Slogans" example shows how a single word can be a complete enunciation, requiring an extra something outside the scope of linguistic categories.

---

#### A Pragmatic Perspective

**July 4, 1917: End of Soviet Power**
- External circumstances: war and insurrection forced Lenin to flee
- Transformation was uttered before organization of Party itself (Soviets)
- Specific features of political situation determine particular slogans

**Politics and Language**
- Politics shapes language from within, affecting vocabulary, structure, and phrasing elements
- Statements evaluated based on pragmatic implications and implicit presuppositions
- Intuition evaluates internal variables of enunciation in context of circumstances

**Order-Words and Immanent Acts**
- Order-words: implicit presuppositions leading to immanent acts or incorporeal transformations
- Redundancy in process of transmission, immediately related to act they effectuate
- Order-words exist prior to conscious recognition as direct discourse

**Collective Assemblages and Semiotics**
- Society influenced by multiple semiotics (regimes of signs)
- New order-words emerge, modifying variables not yet part of known regime
- Indirect discourse: reported statement within reporting statement
- Language is indirect discourse, with direct discourse extracted from it

**The Role of the Speaker/Writer**
- Dependent on molecular assemblage of enunciation
- Extracting self from unconscious voices and secret idioms
- Direct discourse derived from free indirect discourse running through us

**Order-Words and Language Function**
- Order-words effectuate condition of possibility for language (superlinearity)
- Collective assemblages express implicit presuppositions, not equated with languages
- Language function: transmission of order-words; related to assemblages and incorporeal transformations
- Linguistics requires pragmatics (semiotic or political) to define language usage.

---

### II. There Is an Abstract Machine of Language That Does Not Appeal to Any 'Extrinsic' Factor

**Abstract Machine of Language and its Distinction from Extrinsic Factors**
- Social field contains corporeal modifications (body) and incorporeal transformations (expression)
- Content: hand-tool pole or lesson of things, has own formalization but opposed to expression
- Expression: face-language pole, or lesson of signs, has own formalization but independent from content
- Stoics first theorized this independence, distinguishing between actions/passions of bodies and incorporeal acts (statements)
- Forms of expression and content are not of same nature, cannot be assigned one to represent other
- Incorporeal transformations apply to bodies but not as representation or referent
- Speech act when expressing noncorporeal attribute, intervening in a way (attributing to body)
- Expressions inserted into contents, anticipate or move them back, slow down or speed up, separate or combine them
- Independence of forms confirmed by their reciprocal presupposition and continual passage from one to another
- Determining points of intervention or insertion in the framework of reciprocal presupposition

**Deterritorialization of Forms and its Implications for Assemblages**
- Both expression and content are deterritorialized, relatively so according to their particular state
- No primacy of one form over another, degrees of deterritorialization quantify them
- Semiotics and material components can be more or less deterritorialized
- Criminal action may deterritorialize in relation to sign system, vice versa
- Circumstances or variables are these degrees of deterritorialization

**Conclusion**
- Assemblage comprises two segments: content and expression
- Forms of expression and forms of content communicate through conjunction of their quanta of relative deterritorialization.

---

#### Machines, Bodies, and Expressions

**Assemblage Concepts:**
- Machinic assemblage: intermingling of bodies reacting to one another, territorial sides that stabilize it, and cutting edges of deterritorialization
- Collective assemblage: acts and statements attributed to bodies, incorporeal transformations, jurisdictional regime of enunciation
- Vertical axis: territorial sides vs. reterritorializations, line of flight or deterritorialization (K.-function)
- Horizontal axis: interminglings of bodies defining an assemblage and statements/expressions

**Misconceptions:**
1. Content determines expression by causal action: incorrect
2. Forms of content and expression are independent
3. Expressions intervene in productivity, not just reflect content
4. Ideological conception of statement has difficulties with dialectics
5. Material or machinic aspect relates to interminglings of bodies, not production of goods
6. Primacy of the machinic assemblage over tools and goods
7. Collective or semiotic aspect related to regimes of signs rather than productivity of language
8. Articulation of two aspects effected by deterritorialization movements
9. Social field defined by lines of flight, not conflicts and contradictions
10. Assemblage has no base or superstructure; flat structure upon which reciprocal presuppositions play out.

#### The Abstract Machine and Pragmatics in the Rhizome Model

**Understanding the Relationship between Language and Abstract Machine**

**Pragmatics and Semantics**:
- Pragmatic values or internal variables require superlinearity in abstract machine
- Implies a plane whose elements no longer have fixed linear order: rhizome model
- Pragmatic problems intertwined with language and social field, political issues at deepest level of the abstract machine
- Distinction between two states:
  - Variables of content and expression distributed according to their heterogeneous forms in reciprocal presupposition on a plane of consistency
  - Absolute threshold of deterritorialization reached, indiscernibility between variables of content and expression

**Abstract Machine vs. Chomsky's Abstract Machine**:
- Abstract machine not purely about language without sufficient abstraction
- Chomsky's abstract machine retains arborescent model and linear ordering of linguistic elements in sentences and sentence combinations
- To account for pragmatic values or internal variables, need to bring hypersentences into play or construct abstract objects (incorporeal transformations)

**Importance of Abstraction**:
- Reaching a level where pseudoconstants of language are superseded by variables of expression internal to enunciation itself
- This abstraction leads us to understand the abstract machine as a diagram of the entire assemblage, not just language.

---

### III. There Are Constants or Universals of Language That Enable Us to Define It as a Homogeneous System

**The Constants or Universals of Language as a Homogeneous System**

**Invariants in Linguistics**:
- Essential to linguistics and its claim to scientificity
- Includes constants at various levels: phonological, syntactical, semantic
- Universals of language (decomposition of phoneme, syntax, signification)
- Trees linking constants to one another with binary relations
- Competence, grammaticality, homogeneity, and synchrony

**Chomsky vs. Labov**:
- Chomsky's interest in variable features seen as pragmatic and external to linguistics
- Labov sees variation as a systematic component affecting each system from within
- Debate over the nature of the abstract machine and its relationship to the universal or constant

**Continuous Variation in Language**:
- An individual may speak differently in various roles (father, boss, lover)
- Phonology, syntax, semantics may differ between these variations
- The question is whether this language is defined by invariants or continuous variation
- Suggestion that linguistic change occurs more through gradual modification of frequency than systemic rupture

---

#### From Tonal to Atonal Expressions

**Continuous Variation**
- Placing statement through all prosodic, semantic, syntactical, and phonological variables for shortest moment of time (smallest interval)
- Pragmatics internal to language: including variations of linguistic elements of all kinds
- Constant tendency to seek reduction: everything explained by situation of child with father or man with castration or citizen with law
- Placing in variation allows avoidance of dangers and builds continuum or medium without beginning or end

**Continuous vs. Discontinuous Variable**
- Continuous over portion of trajectory, then leaps or skips, impairs continuous variation but also prepares disaggregation of central principle
- Inherent ambiguity: stretching action of center to most distant tones while preparing dissolution of central principle
- Relative tonality preserves new modalities and conquers realms of continuous variation for this variable or that

**Tonal System vs. Atonal Music**
- Ferment in tonal system that dissolved temperament and widened chromaticism during much of 19th and 20th centuries
- Conquered new amalgamation of major and minor, reinventing modalities and bringing audibility to nonsonorous forces of cosmos
- No correspondence between music and language, but objection left open, issue kept unresolved, especially language-speech distinction
- Voice in music a privileged axis of experimentation: functions as constant circumscribed on note and accompanied by instrument when sung
- Timbre reveals tessitura that renders voice heterogeneous to itself and gives power of continuous variation: truly machined, belongs to musical machine that prolongs or superposes sounds
- Generalized glissando implies constitution of statistical space in which each variable has probability of frequency and placed in continuous variation with other variables.

---

#### The Continuous Variation of Speech and Language

**Chromatic Languages and Continuous Variation:**
- Ethnomusicologists have found extraordinary cases where vocal parts are superseded by chromatic descents into secret languages (Dahomey)
- These languages effect continuous variations of common language elements instead of lexical inventions or rhetorical figures
- Secret languages place public language system in a state of variation, resulting in generalized chromaticism
- Linguistics still operates by diatonic scale and universals while all languages are in immanent continuous variation (asynchrony)

**Bilingual Situations and Creative Stammering:**
- Many authors in bilingual situations create unique procedures of variation and widened chromaticism
- Gherasim Luca's creative stammering in Passionnement is an example
- Godard, Wilson, Bene also use internal pragmatics to treat nonlinguistic elements like gestures and instruments as part of the same continuum
- Struggle between etre (to be) and et (and) in language: constant vs variation

**Placing Linguistic Variables in Continuous Variation:**
- Creative subtraction and sobriety lead to intensive language, placing all variables in continuous variation
- Agrammaticality is not an opposition to real but the ideal characteristic of a line placing grammatical variables in virtual variation (e.g., Cummings's expressions)
- Atypical expressions produce deterritorialization and tensor effect, causing language to tend towards its elements' limits.

---

#### Variation, Power, and the Singularity of Expression

**The Tensor Effect in Language**
- The tensor effects a kind of transitivization of the phrase, causing the last term to react upon the preceding term, back through the entire chain.
- It assures an intensive and chromatic treatment of language.
- An expression like "AND" can play the role of a tensor for all possible conjunctions.
- The tensor is not reducible to a constant or variable but ensures the variation of the variable by subtracting the value of the constant (n - 1).
- Tensors do not coincide with any linguistic category, yet are pragmatic values essential for both assemblages of enunciation and indirect discourses.

**Abstract Machine vs. Assemblage of Enunciation**
- Abstract machines draw lines of continuous variation while the concrete assemblage treats variables and their relations as a function of those lines.
- The assemblage negotiates variables at different levels of variation and degrees of deterritorialization.
- There is no distinction between constant and collective language, and variable and individual speech acts.
- Abstract machines are singular while assemblages are collective; they are complementary and present in each other.

**Language as a Scientific Object of Study**
- Linguists carve out a homogeneous system to make scientific study possible by extracting constants or constant relations.
- The scientific model takes language as an object of study, which is one with the political model of homogenizing, centralizing, and standardizing language as a "major" or "dominant" language.
- Linguistics claims to be science but is coupled with the political enterprise of imposing constants on speakers.
- The distinction between "high" and "low," "major," and "minor" languages is questionable, as dialects define the possibilities for variation in a minor language.

---

#### Constancy, Homogeneity, and Variation

**The Relationship Between Major and Minor Languages**

**French vs. Afrikaans**:
- French lost its worldwide major function, but retained its constancy and homogeneity as a centralized language
- Afrikaans became more homogeneous when it was a locally minor language struggling against English
- Politically, it is difficult for the upholders of a minor language to operate without asserting the rights of their language through writing in it

**The Dynamics of Major and Minor Languages**:
- The more a language acquires the characteristics of a major language, the more it is affected by continuous variations that transpose it into a minor language
- It is futile to criticize the imperialism of a major language by denouncing corruptions in other languages
- Linguistic variation occurs both through intralinguistic, endogenous processes and external influences

**The Treatment of Language Variables**:
- **Chomsky's position**: Extracting invariants and eliminating extrinsic or mixed variables from a minor language
- **Labov's position**: Studying the continuous variation within a major language
- **Constants vs. Variables**: Constants are not opposed to, but rather a treatment of variables

**Bilingualism and Language Dynamics**:
- Bilingual individuals treat their "major" language as a minor or patois in certain contexts
- This transformation of the major language into a minor one occurs through the rejection of reference points and dissolution of constant form

---

#### Language, Consciousness, and Becoming

**Minor Authors and Majority vs. Minoritarian**
- Minor authors are "helpers" who master their own language to create continuous variation
- They experience themselves as "bastards," not due to language mixing, but subtraction of their own language
- The term "minority" is complex with musical, literary, linguistic, juridical, and political references
- Majority implies a standard measure for evaluation, which the minority deviates from
- Majority holds power and domination, not the other way around
- Marxism often focuses on the national worker as "major," but minorities can create change by triggering uncontrollable movements
- Continuous variation constitutes the becoming-minoritarian of everybody, called autonomy
- The order-word is a death sentence that also functions as a message to flee

**Order-Word and Its Significance**
- The order-word has two aspects: death and flight
- It meets the requirements for an incorporeal transformation: authentic, instantaneous, and enunciated with statement
- Death is an ideal boundary separating bodies, forms, and states; a condition for change

**Minorities as Subsystems vs. Becoming-Minoritarian**
- Minorities are objectively definable states but must be thought of as seeds of becoming
- They trigger uncontrollable movements and deterritorializations, affecting all humankind
- Becoming-minoritarian is called autonomy and addressed to powers beyond the realm of Power and Domination.

---

#### The Interplay of Death and Transformation in Bodies and Expressions

**Canetti's Enantiomorphosis: Hieratic Regimes and Incorporeal Transformations**

**Enantiomorphosis**:
- Hieratic regime with an immutable Master legislating by constants, prohibiting or limiting metamorphoses
- Bodies are distinguished by non-corporeal attributes (figures) that limit and complete them
- Death is the figure that completes a body in time and space, forming its lines and outlines
- Practiced often, it shrivels the whole world

**Social Prohibitions Against Metamorphosis**:
- Most important of all social prohibitions
- Death as a boundary between classes
- New bodies require formation of distinct subjects and erection of opposable forms

**Reciprocal Presupposition of Expression and Content**:
- Both planes are in reciprocal presupposition, despite being distinct
- Incorporeal transformation is the expressed of order-words but also the attribute of bodies
- Non-linguistic variables of content enter into formal opposition with linguistic variables of expression

**Isomorphism and Continuous Variation**:
- Elements of content give clear contours to interminglings of bodies
- Elements of expression give power of sentencing or judgment
- Incorporeal transformation is a passage to the limit, reducing death or making it a variation

**Minor Sciences vs. Major Sciences**:
- Intense matter freed in internal tensors of language and tensions of content
- Transformation of substances and dissolution of forms
- Passage to the limit where body or word does not end at a precise point

**The Absolute Deterritorialization on the Plane of Consistency**:
- Differences constituted in a single matter serving both for expression as incorporeal power and for content as limitless corporeality
- Conjunction of cutting edges of deterritorialization on both sides
- Synthesizer places all parameters in continuous variation, conjugating heterogeneous elements into a rhizome throughout the entire assemblage.

---

#### Order and Passage

**The Importance of Variation and Continuous Dialogue**
- The virtual line or continuum of life can only be brought forth through continuous variation
- Dry speech is necessary for questioning answers, not just accepting them
- Answers already contain the question, so responding with questions from another answer brings forth new perspectives
- Order-words mark stoppages or organized compositions, while pass-words facilitate passage and create flight
- A single thing or word has a twofold nature - it is necessary to extract the component of passage from its ordered composition.

## 5. 587 B.c.-A.D. 70: On Several Regimes of Signs

**Semiotic Systems and Regimes of Signs**

**Definition of a Regime of Signs**:
- Specific formalization of expression within a semiotic system
- Constitutes a semiotic system
- Autonomous and self-sufficient, but diversity in forms makes universal privilege difficult to assign

**Signifying Regime of the Sign**:
- Every sign refers to another sign, ad infinitum
- Limitlessness of significance replaces the sign itself
- Denotation (designation and signification) is assumed to be part of connotation
- Attention paid to indexes and icons is limited

**Impact on the Signifier**:
- Deterritorialization leads to formal relation between signs, forming a "signifying chain"
- Impotence and uncertainty of the deterritorialized sign
- Paranoiac shares this impotence, but gains access to the power of the signifier

**Circularity and Multiplicity of Sign Chains**:
- Signs form infinite, circular networks
- Sign refers not only to other signs in the same circle but also to signs in other circles
- Differences between " Crow" and "Hopi" cultures: Crows react violently, while Hopis withdraw and pray
- Regulated jumps between thresholds/circles with rules and prohibitions

**Role of Deception**:
- Hysteric operation of the deceiver as subject
- Paranoid operation of the despot installed in the center of signifiance

---

### Signification, Interpretation, and the Despot-God

**Signifying Regime and Interpretance/Interpretation:**
- Signifying regime organizes signs emitted from all directions
- Must assure expansion of circles or spiral to overcome entropy and create new signs
- Interpretance/interpretation necessary for this process
  - Signifier assumes new figure as amorphous continuum given without being known
  - Portion of signified made to correspond to a sign or group of signs
  - Adds paradigmatic axis where the formalized sign fashions its suitable signified
- Interpretation carried to infinity, reimparting signifier from the ultimate signified (signifier itself)
- Signifiance and interpretosis are two diseases of humankind's fundamental neurosis

**Faciality:**
- Language always accompanied by faciality traits
- Face crystallizes redundancies, emits and receives, releases and recaptures signifying signs
- Reveals the limit of deterritorialized signs
- Signifier reterritorializes on the face
- Faciality reigns materially over constellation of significances and interpretations

**Despot/God:**
- Everything is public in signifying regime, no secrecy
- Face or body of despot/god has a counterbody: body of tortured or excluded
  - Torture marks loss of face, entering becoming-animal/becoming-molecular
  - Scapegoat represents increased entropy and absolute deterritorialization in the system of signs.

---

### From Signifying to Postsignifying Regimes

**The Signifying Regime:**
- Consists of a despot-god in the center of the temple, interpreting priests, hysterical crowd outside, and a faceless scapegoat
- Characterized by limitlessness of signification, circularity, metaphor or hysteria, interpretation, supreme signifier (despotic), faciality traits, scapegoating, and universal deception
- Not the first or most privileged semiotic system

**The Presignifying Semiotic:**
- Closer to natural codings without signs
- Polyvocality of forms of expression preserved
- Confrontation between territorialities and segments from which each sign is extracted
- Segmentarity as law, preserves expressive forms particular to content
- Prevents power takeover by the signifier
- Animated by a presentiment of what's to come, fights against universalizing abstraction and circularity

**The Countersignifying Semiotic:**
- Proceeds less by segmentarity than by arithmetic and numeration
- Organized into tens, fifties, hundreds, thousands, etc.
- Spatial organization adopted by state armies but specific to nomadic military systems
- Secrecy and spying important elements
- Line of abolition replaces imperial despotic line of flight, turning back against empires or integrating with them to form a mixed semiotic

**The Postsignifying Regime:**
- Not covered in detail but defined by subjectification as unique procedure.

---

### Paranoid vs. Passional Regimes

**Semiotics and Regimes of Significance**
- **Presignifying elements**: Always active in signifying regime
- **Countersignifying elements**: Present and at work within signifying regime
- **Postsignifying elements**: Already there, but not necessarily predominant

**Two Types of Delusions without Intellectual Diminishment**
1. Paranoid or interpretive delusions: Insidious onset, hidden center, network stretching across amorphous continuum, radiating circles expanding in all directions, transformation of atmosphere as function of variable traits
2. Passional or grievance delusion: Decisive external occurrence, relation with outside expressed more as emotion than idea, limited constellation operating in single sector, postulate serving as point of departure for linear series or proceeding, runs its course before new proceeding begins

**Psychiatry and the Two Types of Delusions**
- Psychiatrist was not constituted around concept of madness but split between:
  * Pleading for tolerance and understanding, underscoring uselessness of confinement, appealing for open-door asylums
  * Arguing for increased surveillance and special high-security asylums
- Distinction between paranoiacs (bourgeois) and monomaniacs (working/rural classes or marginal) reflects class divide

**Postsignifying Regime vs. Signifying Regime**
- In postsignifying regime, sign detaches from network and sets to work on its own account, starts running a straight line, positively occupied by people finding their reason for being or destiny in it. Unlike signifying regime, this line receives a positive value.

---

### Cain, Jonah, and Jesus as Linear Proceedings

**Jewish Semiotic System:**
- Detachment from Egyptian imperial network
- Line of flight into the desert: passional delusion vs. interpretational paranoid delusion
- Destruction and rebuilding of Temple (587 BC, AD 70)
- Nomadic past and relationship with numerical organization
- Postsignifying subjective or passional regime

**Faciality Transformation:**
- God averts his face, subject averts in response
- Double turning away draws positive line of flight
- Prophet as traitor fulfilling God's order better than faithful

**Key Figures:**
- Moses: leads people, receives great song of betrayal
- Jonah: flees from God, taken into sea and vomited out, betrays effectively
- Cain: marked with sign allowing escape, protected by a reprieve
- Jesus: universalizes system of betrayal, betrayed by all parties involved.

**Significance of Betrayal:**
- Renewed covenant through occupation of line of flight (Jonah, Moses)
- Prophet declines burden to anticipate God's will more effectively.

---

#### "Exploring the Prophetic Nature of Betrayal in Mythology and Psychoanalysis"

**Oedipus vs. Prometheus: Two Mythological Figures**
- **Oedipus**: Greek Cain, Semitic myth of the Greeks, glorification of Passion or passivity, wanders and survives on a positive line of separation or deterri-torialization
- **Prometheus**: Imperial, despotic, interpretive, divinatory first part; Oedipus's wandering, line of flight, double turning away of his own face and that of God in the second part.

**Mixed Semiotics: Despotic Regime vs. Authoritarian Regime**
- **Psychoanalysis**: Mixed semiotic - despotic regime of signifiance and interpretation, with irradiation of the face, and an authoritarian regime of subjectification and prophetism, with turning away of the face (psychoanalyst's position)
- Two absolutely different regimes in a mix
- Syncretic efforts to explain signifier represents the subject for another signifier: linear proceeding of subjectivity along with circular development of the signifier and interpretation.

**Authoritarian Passional Betrayal vs. Despotic Paranoid Deception**
- Everything is infamy in authoritarian passional betrayal
- Oedipus transforms ideal signifying system and postsignifying passional system, creating a new assemblage (Christianity)
- Heresies are still part of deception but some profess pure treason (Buggers)
- Figures of betrayal return at certain places and times with new components.

**Deterritorialization and Traitors:**
- England: Cromwell, traitor against royal center of signifiance and intermediary circles
- Richard III: twisted, confronts Lady Anne in a face-off, wants to return war machine to fragile State and pacified couples
- Elizabethan theater full of traitorous characters who aspire to be absolute traitors.

**Betrayal vs. Deception:**
- Betrayal has become humanist, relying on God but falling between men of God and others (deceivers)
- Every deceiver is mixed, and which does not take him/herself to be the one?
- What betrayer does not say to himself/herself at some point that he or she was nothing but a deceiver after all?

**Books: Oral Character vs. Sacred Written Book**
- In signifying paranoid regime, emission of despotic signifier and interpretation, circulation assuring deterritorialization (e.g., epic circulation)
- In passional regime, book seems internalized, internalizes everything, becomes the sacred written Book.

---

### A Study on God, Cogito, and Monomania

**Passional Delusion and the Regime of Subjectification**

**Points of Departure for Passionate Line:**
- **Jews vs Empires**: God as a point of subjectification, Moses as subject of enunciation, Jewish people as subject of statement
- **Modern Philosophy (Cartesian)**: Primacy of infinite as point of subjectification, Cogito as subject of enunciation, union of soul and body as subject of statement
- **19th Century Psychiatry**: Monomania distinguished from mania, passional delusion as cogito

**Characteristics of Subjective Semiotics:**
1. Point of subjectification: anything that displays betrayal, existence under reprieve
2. Linearity and segmentation: one proceeding must end before another begins
3. Origin of passional line in point of subjectification
4. Double turning away (betrayal)
5. Existence under reprieve

**Examples:**
- Anorexics: food as point of subjectification
- Fetishists: things, animals, body parts
- Faciality traits for someone in love

**Shifting Points of Subjectification:**
- Education or normalization: changing points of subjectification towards a higher one
- From subject of enunciation issues a subject of statement

---

### A Passional Double

**The Passionate Line of Subjectification or Subjection**

**Subjectification**:
- Collective or particular individuation following Uniformity established by signifiance
- Subject recoils into subject of statement, with respondent/guarantor role reversal in biunivocal relation
- Appeal to dominant reality that functions immanently through normalization
- Invention of new form of slavery: being slave to oneself or pure reason
- Linguists' personology similar to Cogito, with "You" as point of subjectification and "I" as subject of enunciation/statement

**Psychoanalysis**:
- Psychoanalyst presents as ideal point of subjectification
- Patient is partially a subject of enunciation in session, called analysand
- Otherwise, patient is subject of statement, eternally psychoanalyzed and growing more submissive to dominant reality

**Subjectification vs. Ideology**:
- Subjectification is regime of signs/formalization, not movement characteristic of ideology
- Capital is a point of subjectification par excellence

**Love as Passion**:
- Love has two axes: consciousness (doubling and recoiling of subjects) and love as passion (betrayal and cogito's evil genius)
- Tristan and Isolde example: intense consciousness with a continuous melody line, while ship follows line of death/unconsciousness.

**Doubles in Love-Passion**:
- Over-intense thought and over-feverish couple
- Syntagmatic figure of consciousness (Self = Self) and paradigmatic figure of the couple (Man = Woman), with difference between sexes as passional double.

---

### Frequency, Resonance, and Deterritorialization

**Conjugality and Bureaucracy in the Cogito**
- Conjugal relation vs. domestic squabble: battle of enunciation, theft of thoughts
  - Strindberg's extreme example: hysterico-paranoid squabbling (she owes it all to me)
- Pure thought double: legislating subject falls into bureaucratic relation and persecution
  - One double becomes subject of enunciation, other reduced to subject of statement
- New form of bureaucracy replaces imperial bureaucracy
  - Example from Kafka's work: Sortini and Sordini in "The Castle" or the subjectifications of Klamm

**Conjugality and Bureaucracy: Development of the Cogito**
- Conjugality is development of couple, bureaucracy is development of cogito
- Both contained in each other: amorous bureaucracy, bureaucratic couple

**Differences Between Signifying Regime and Postsignifying Regime**
- Signifying regime: frequency of signs, high level of deterritorialization but relative
  - Line of flight remains negative, assigned a negative sign
- Postsignifying regime: resonance of self-consciousness and names
  - Absolute deterritorialization expressed in black hole of consciousness and passion
  - Redundancy of subjective resonance, absolute deterritorialization with impotence and intensity

**Subjectification Repudiates Its Positivity**
- Subjectification constitutes finite linear proceedings, every consciousness pursues its own death
- Impedes on the line of flight with segmentarity, blocks deterritorialization or diverts it
- Reason: forms of expression and regimes of signs are still strata

**Desubjectifying Consciousness and Passion**
- Let consciousness be an experimentation in life, passion a field of continuous intensities
- Use love and consciousness to abolish subjectification
- Become the great lover, magnetizer, and catalyzer
- Diagrammatic redundancies distinct from signifying and subjective redundancies?
  - Stammer language, be a foreigner in your own tongue.

---

### The Transformative Power of Semiotics

**Deterritorialization:**
- Three types: relative, absolute negative, and positive absolute
- Relative deterritorialization: confrontation between territorialities and segmentary lineages
- Signifying semiotic: overcoding by signifier and State apparatus, uniformity of enunciation, control over statements
- Countersignifying semiotic: overcoding assured by Number as form of expression or War Machine, destruction or abolition of deterritorialization
- Postsignifying semiotic: subjectification of enunciation, immanent organization of power, raising deterritorialization to the absolute but negatively

**Components of Deterritorialization:**
1. Center or Signifier (god or despot)
2. Temple or Palace with priests and bureaucrats
3. Organization in circles and sign referring to other signs on same or different circles
4. Interpretive development of signifier into signified, reimparting signifier
5. Expiatory animal; blocking line of flight
6. Scapegoat, negative sign of line of flight

**Semiotics:**
1. Concrete mixed semiotics: every semiotic is mixed and captures fragments of others
2. Abstract pure semiotics: transformations through overcoding as language's special characteristic (analogical, symbolic, countersignifying, postsignifying, diagrammatic)
3. Transformational statements: mark way a semiotic translates for its purposes a statement originating elsewhere while diverting it and leaving untransformable residues
4. New pure regimes of signs formed through transformation and translation
5. No general semiology but transsemiotic

**Examples:**
- Sleep, drugs, amorous rapture: analogical transformations in presignifying or signifying regimes
- Monetary signs in Africa: difficult to control when undergoing an analogical transformation into a destructive transformation instead
- Songs of black Americans: blending African languages with English language and showing how slaves transformed music through subjectification or individuation.

**Symbolic Translations:**
- Crudest and most visible transformations are in the opposite direction: symbolic translations occurring when signifier takes power (African dance to white dance)
- Consciousness-related or mimetic translation accompanied by a power takeover by signifiance and subjectification.

---

### The Role of Pragmatics in Regimes of Signs

**Understanding Semiotics and Pragmatics**

**Dominant atmospheric semiotic:**
- Difficult to get away from a highly stratified semiotic
- Even an asignifying diagram may contain knots of coincidence

**True semiotic transformation:**
- Involves destruction of dominant atmospheric semiotic
- Appeals to all variables, external and internal to language
- Pragmatics:
  - Generative pragmatics: Traces mixed semiotics and their combinations
  - Transformational pragmatics: Maps transformations between regimes of signs

**Examples:**
- Bolshevik statements and the rise of Leninism
- Nazism as a system of new statements in social field
- Psychiatric diagnosis in 19th century vs ancient history of Jews

**Language versus Regime of Signs:**
- Language: condition of possibility, utilizes language elements but not identical to it
- Regimes of signs: functions of existence of language, intersect and cause appearance in space and time.

**Enunciation Assemblages:**
- Significance and subjectification presuppose the assemblage, not vice versa
- Cannot be adequately accounted for by any linguistic category.

---

### A Diagram of Matter and Function in Semiotics and Physics

**The Differences Between Regimes of Signs and Language:**

**Regimes of Signs vs. Language:**
- Defined by variables internal to enunciation but external to language's constants
- Less than language due to lack of linguistic categories
- More than language because they formalize both content and expression
- Machinic assemblage or an assemblage of bodies (physical systems)
- Abstract machine conjugates all components of the assemblage

**Abstract Machine:**
- Constitutes and conjugates all parts of an assemblage
- Deeper than regimes of signs and language
- Not limited to form of expression or univocals that presuppose language
- Diagrammatic: operates by matter, not substance; function, not form
- Distinguished from indexes, icons, symbols
- Doesn't make distinction within itself between content and expression
- Absolute deterritorialization creates continuums of intensity and effects conjunctions of deterritorialization.

**Components of Abstract Machine:**
- Diagram: diagrams independent of forms and substances, expressions and contents it will distribute
- Matter: unformed matter or substance
- Function: functional connections between content and expression

**Abstract Machines in History:**
- Wagner abstract machine, Webern abstract machine in music
- Riemann abstract machine, Galois abstract machine in physics and mathematics.

**Regimes of Signs:**
- Singular points of creation or potentiality that escape history but are always prior to it
- Stratified: double articulation formalizes traits of expression and content separately on different strata.

**Formalization vs. Abstract Machine:**
- Form of expression is no longer distinct from form of content at the diagrammatic level.

---

### A Dualistic Perspective on Expression and Content

**Stratification of Language**

**Substantialization of Diagrammatic Matters**
- Culminates in a language stratum that installs an abstract machine on expression level
- Abstracts content further, stripping it of its own form (imperialism of language)
- Strata separate formed planes of content and expression
- Double articulation assures independence and real distinction
- Reproduces and redivides dualism

**Stratification vs. Diagrammaticism**
- Axiomatic operations block creative lines of flight, stabilize diagrams
- Subordinates all lines to punctual system, halts geometric/algebraic writing systems
- Reorders mathematics, physical flows for reconciliation with determinism
- Political as well as scientific affair

**Two Components of Regime of Signs (Pragmatics)**

**Generative Component**:
- Forms of expression located on language stratum appeal to several combined regimes
- Abstracting forms of content from the mixture of regimes in form of expression
- Does not imply predominance of a general semiology unifying forms

**Transformational Component**:
- One abstract regime can be translated, transformed into another
- Creates new abstract regimes from other regimes

---

### The Study of Language as Machinic Assemblages and Abstract Machines

**The Four Circular Components of Pragmatics (or Schizoanalysis)**

**1. Generative Component**:
- Study of concrete mixed semiotics
- Mixtures and variations of regimes of signs

**2. Transformational Component**:
- Analysis of pure semiotics
- Transformations, translations, and creation of new semiotics
- Creation of abstract machines as potentialities or emergences

**3. Diagrammatic Component**:
- Study of abstract machines from the standpoint of unformed matters
- Relation to physically unformed matters
- Analysis of abstract machines that are in play in each case

**4. Machinic Component**:
- Examination of assemblages that effectuate abstract machines
- Semiotizing matters of expression and physicalizing matters of content
- Study of the assemblages that distribute and bring circulation to movements with alternatives, jumps, and mutations

**Pragmatics (or Schizoanalysis)**:
- Tracing mixed semiotics under generative component
- Mapping transformational regimes and possibilities for translation and transformation
- Creating new, unknown statements in various regimes

**Example of Analysis**:
- Proposition "I love you" has different meanings depending on the regime of signs (collective, distributive, interpretive, passional)
- Determining which statement corresponds to a given proposition in a group or individual at a given time
- Looking into possibilities for mixture, transformation, and creation of new statements
- Covering various regimes: precious, metaphorical, stultifying, patois of sensual delight, becomings-animal, becomings-molecular, real transsexualities, continuums of intensity, constitutions of bodies without organs

**Universal Prepositional Logic and Grammar**:
- Abstraction of levels that are too abstract and not abstract enough
- Regimes of signs not based on language, but language is based on regimes of signs and abstract machines.

## 6. November 28, 1947: `How Do You Make Yourself a Body without Organs?`

**Body without Organs (BwO)**

**Concept of BwO**:
- Not a notion or concept, but a practice and set of practices
- A limit that one cannot reach, yet forever attained
- People are already on it in various ways: desert traveler, nomad, sleeper, fighter, lover, etc.
- Experimentation with the body beyond organs, incurring censorship and repression

**Types of BwO**:
- **Hypochondriac Body**: Organs are destroyed, damage already done, nothing happens anymore
- **Paranoid Body**: Organs under attack by outside forces, but also restored by energies
- **Schizo Body**: Waging internal struggle against organs, at the price of catatonia
- **Masochist Body**: Sewing up body parts to stop organs from working
- **Drugged Body**: Experimentation with efficiency and inefficiency of human body

**Experimentation vs. Psychoanalysis**:
- Experimentation: Let's go further, dismantle self, find BwO
- Psychoanalysis: Stop, find self again, retain phantasy

**Masochist Body and Pain Intensities**:
- Masochist looks for a type of BwO that only pain can fill or travel over
- Pains are populations, modes of king-masochist-in-the-desert that he engenders and augments

---

### Fabrication, Modes, and Intensities

**Body Without Organs (BwO)**

**Definition**:
- Set of valves, locks, floodgates, bowls, or communicating vessels
- Each with a proper name: a peopling of the BwO
- Causes intensities to pass; produces and distributes them in a spatium that is itself intensive

**BwO Fabrication**:
- A special relation of synthesis and analysis between a given type of BwO and what happens on it
- **A priori synthesis**: Something will necessarily be produced in a given mode, but not the specific outcome
- **Infinite analysis**: What is produced on the BwO is already part of its production, included in the body, on it (at the cost of an infinity of passages, divisions, and secondary productions)

**BwO Functioning**:
- Can be occupied only by intensities
- Intensities pass and circulate
- Not a scene, place, or support for something to come to pass
- Does not involve phantasy or interpretation

**BwO Attributes and Modes**:
- Substances, powers, zero intensities as matrices of production
- Everything that comes to pass: waves and vibrations, migrations, thresholds and gradients, intensities produced in a given type of substance
- **Examples**: Masochist body, drugged body

**Continuum of BwO's**:
- Is there a totality of all BwO's?
- Problem is not One and the Multiple but fusional multiplicity beyond opposition between one and multiple
- Formal multiplicity of substantial attributes constituting ontological unity of substance
- Continuum of all substances in intensity and intensities of each genus under a single type or attribute

**BwO and Desire**:
- Field of immanence for desire, the plane of consistency specific to desire
- Desire betrayed by negative law, extrinsic rule, and transcendent ideal
- Psychoanalyst as modern figure of the priest with three principles: Pleasure, Death, Reality

---

### A Study on Desire and Intensities

**Masochism and Desire:**

**Psychoanalysis and Masochism:**
- Psychoanalysis demonstrated desire is not subordinated to procreation or genitality, but retained essentials: negative law of lack, pleasure, transcendent ideal of phantasy.
- Interpretation of masochism: masochist seeks pleasure through suffering as a way to untie the bond between desire and pleasure.
- Suffering is a price paid to delay pleasure and prevent it from interrupting continuous process of positive desire.
- Joy immanent to desire, not measured by pleasure or anxiety, shame, guilt.

**Masochist's Procedure:**
- Using suffering as way to constitute body without organs (BwO) and bring forth a plane of consistency for desire.
- Training axiom: exchange and circulation of forces instead of destruction.
- Horse training metaphor for masochism: horse transmits transmitted forces, taming innate human ones.
- Result: continual expectancy of actions and orders, fusion of self with other.

**Courtly Love:**
- Desire fills itself and constructs its own field of immanence instead of being based on lack or transcendence.
- Orgasm a fact that interrupts the flow of desire; joy in courtly love is the exchange of intensities.
- Joy not internal to self or external, but part of absolute Outside where interior and exterior have fused.

**Taoist Circuit:**
- Japanese compilation from A.D. 982-984 described female and male energy circulation between them.
- Woman plays role of instinctive force stolen by or transmitted to man, making him innate.
- Condition for circulation: man does not ejaculate; not about desire as internal lack or delaying pleasure but constituting an intensive BwO.
- Tao side of destratification draws a plane of consistency proper to desire, independent from strata and organisms.

---

### Anarchy and Unity in the Body Without Organs

**The Plane of Consistency and BwO's (Bodies without Organs)**

**Concepts:**
- Plane of consistency: totality of all BwO's, a pure multiplicity of immanence
- BwO: piece of immanence, different types with varying degrees 0 as principle of production
- Intensities and waves produced on each type of BwO
- Assemblages necessary to fabricate each BwO
- Great abstract Machine required to construct the plane of consistency
- Plateaus: continuous regions of intensity without external interruptions or climaxes (examples: sexual, aggressive processes in Balinese culture)
- Each BwO made up of plateaus and itself a plateau on the plane of consistency

**Challenges:**
- Making oneself a BwO and producing corresponding intensities without organs
- Reaching the plane of consistency and sewing together all BwO's
- Producing continuum of all intensive continuities by conjugating intensities on each BwO

**Struggle Against Organism:**
- Artaud's fight against organs is against organism, which is the enemy of the body (BwO)
- Judgment of God: operation of He who makes an organism and rips apart BwO
- Medical doctors benefit from and base their power on organism
- Stratification and bonds imposed upon BwO to extract useful labor

**Three Great Strata:**
- Organism: organized collection of organs, binding us to it
- Significance: interpreter and interpreted, articulate your body and meaning
- Subjectification: nailed down as one, subject of enunciation and statement

**BwO vs. Strata:**
- Disarticulation: ceasing to be an organism, opposes dismantling all strata
- Nomadism: movement on the plane of consistency, keep moving even in place
- Experimentation: operation on the plane of consistency, no signifier or interpretation.

---

### A Journey Beyond Stratification

**Understanding BwO (Body Without Organs)**

**Background:**
- Concept introduced by Guattari in his work on assemblages and strata
- Achieving BwO requires dismantling organism, signifiance, and subjectification

**Importance of Caution:**
- Dismantling strata can lead to death or falsehood if not done carefully
- Keep enough organism for survival
- Maintain small supplies of signifiance and subjectification to respond to reality

**Approach to Reaching BwO:**
1. Lodge on a stratum: experiment with opportunities, find potential movements of deterritorialization
2. Discover connections between desires, conjunctions of flows, continuums of intensities
3. Gradually give up interpretation and construct flow by flow, segment by segment lines of experimentation
4. Become-animal or becoming-molecular: replace history with becomings
5. Replace world of subject with colors, sounds, becomings, and intensities

**Strata:**
1. Organism: physical body and its organization
2. Signifiance: interpretation, explanation, memorizable things
3. Subjectification: self or individual person

**BwO vs Tonal:**
- BwO dismantles strata, replacing them with becomings and intensities
- Tonal includes all the strata and everything ascribed to them (organization of organism, interpretations and explanations of signifiable, movements of subjectification)

**Castaneda's Experiment:**
- Long process of experimentation through peyote or other things
- Finding place, allies, giving up interpretation, constructing flow segment by segment, becoming-animal/molecular.

---

### Artaud's Exploration of Intensity and Transformation

**The BwO and Strata**

**Importance of Protecting the Tonal**
- Preserve the tonal to survive and maintain order against the nagual
- Destruction of the tonal results in self-destruction and death
- Maintain and clean the tonal, not for survival alone but also to create an escape from the organism or fabricate the other BwO on the plane of consistency

**BwO's Within Strata**
- Exists within strata as well as on the destratified plane of consistency
- Cancerous tissue in the organism: a cell that loses configuration and becomes cancerous, requiring resubmission to its rule or restratification for survival and escape from the other BwO
- Cancerous tissue in signification: burgeoning body that blocks circulation of signs, preventing birth of asignifying sign on the plane of consistency
- Stifling body of subjectification: makes freeing more unlikely by forbidding distinction between subjects
- Every formation or apparatus has a BwO ready to gnaw, proliferate, cover, and invade the social field

**Three-Body Problem**
- Distinguishing between full BwO's on the plane of consistency and empty BwO's on destroyed strata is not enough
- Need to consider cancerous BwO's in a stratum that has begun to proliferate

**BwO, Science, Myth, and Embryology**
- The egg designates this intensive reality where things are distinguished by gradients, migrations, zones of proximity
- Egg is the milieu of pure intensity, not regressive but contemporary
- BwO is a childhood block, becoming, the opposite of childhood memory
- Not before or after the organism; it's a contemporary experience and experimentation

**The Error of Psychoanalysis**
- Failed to understand BwO phenomena as regressions, projections, phantasies in terms of an image of the body
- Grasped only the flipside of the BwO and substituted family photos, childhood memories, and part-objects for a worldwide intensity map
- Understood nothing about the egg nor indefinite articles nor contemporaneousness of a continually self-constructing milieu.

---

### A Schizoanalytic Perspective

**The BwO (Body without Organs) is Desire**
- The BwO is desire, both as the object and subject of desire
- Even when it falls into the void or proliferates cancerously, it is still desire

**Desiring Annihilation and Power**
- The BwO desires its own annihilation or has the power to annihilate
- Money, army, police, State, fascist desire, even fascism are expressions of desire
- The construction of the plane of consistency (BwO) is a matter of physical, biological, psychic, social, or cosmic matter

**Distinguishing Desire from Doubles**
- Schizoanalysis must distinguish the BwO from its doubles: empty vitreous bodies, cancerous bodies, totalitarian and fascist
- The test of desire is not denouncing false desires but distinguishing within desire what pertains to stratification or destratification
- Desire on the plane of consistency is distinct from stratic proliferation or too-violent destratification

**The Plane of Consistency as a Totality of Full BwOs**
- The plane of consistency is not simply the sum of all BwOs, it rejects certain things
- Within the BwO (drug user, masochist), we must distinguish what can be composed on the plane and what cannot
- There may be a possible use of paranoia or drugs that conforms to the plane of consistency
- The identity of effects, continuity of genera, totality of all BwOs can only be obtained on the plane by an abstract machine capable of covering and creating it through assemblages

**The Triumph of Emptied or Cancerous Doubles**
- Without the continuous connections and transversal tie-ins of assemblages that take charge of desires, the BwO's of the plane will remain separated by genus, marginalized, and reduced to means of bordering. On the other hand, on the non-plane the emptied or cancerous doubles will triumph.

## 7. Year Zero: Faciality

**Faciality and Semiotics**

**Two Different Semiotic Systems:**
- Significance: white wall with inscribed signs
- Subjectification: black hole of consciousness/passion

**Intersection of Systems:**
- Face as a mechanism at intersection
  - White wall/black hole system (faciality)

**Role of Face in Semiotics:**
1. Guides listener's choices when speaking or thinking
2. Defines zones of frequency or probability for signs and subjectivity
3. Redundancy: face itself is redundant with signifiance and resonance
4. Abstract machine produces faces based on combinations of cogwheels

**Abstract Machine of Faciality:**
- Engendered by abstract machine, not a physical face
- Can be seen in unusual places or states (twilight, hallucinations)
- Circulates in white wall/black hole system

**Face vs. Volume-Cavity System:**
- Face is part of surface-holes system, not the volume-cavity body system
  - Head included in body but face is not.

---

### A Journey Beyond Human and Animal

**Facialization and the Face**
* Facialization is not about resemblance, but an abstract operation that "draws the entire body across the holey surface"
* Produced by a machine (white wall/black hole) that overcodes all parts of the body
* Not limited to human beings or animals, but rather a process that makes everything "facialized"
* Involves a shift from a body-head system to a face system, not based on stages in ontogenesis or integration of part-objects
* Movements of deterritorialization are key: prehensile hand, breast development, human head
* Face represents an absolute deterritorialization that connects the head to other strata like signification and subjectivity
* Landscape is a correlate on a higher level.

#### "The Interconnectedness of Faces and Landscapes in Christian Education and Literature"

**Christian Education and Landscapes**
- Christian education influenced faciality and landscapity (paysage ité)
- Composed, colored, completed faces and landscapes according to complementarity
- Inspired arts as much as they inspired each other

**Architecture, Painting, and Film**
- Architecture positioned buildings to function like faces in the landscape
- Painting treated landscapes as faces or reversed it, positioning a landscape as a face
- Close-ups in film focused on faces primarily as landscapes (definition of film)
- Earlier arts also used this correlation: architecture, painting, even novels

**Mother as Landscape or Face?**
- All faces envelop an unknown, unexplored landscape
- All landscapes are populated by a loved or dreamed-of face
- Faces and landscapes are interconnected

**The Novel Genre**
- Essential part of the novel: lost characters who don't know their name, purpose, or what they're doing
- Novels have always been defined by this adventure of amnesiacs
- Not characteristic of genre of the novel only at its end; an essential part from the beginning

**Three Theorems of Deterritorialization in the Novel**
1. **Two Terms**: One never deterritorializes alone; there are always at least two terms, hand-use object, mouth-breast, face-landscape. Each term reterritorializes on the other.
2. **Speed and Intensity**: Fastest element may not be most intense or deterritorialized; intensity can connect to slowest element.
3. **Vertical System of Reterritorializations**: The least deterritorialized reterritorializes on the most deterritorialized. This is where vertical system comes in, running from bottom to top. Hand and breast, entire body even tool, are facialized during this process.

**Reterritorialization vs. Return to Primitive Territoriality**
- Reterritorialization must not be confused with a return to primitive or older territoriality
- Implies a set of artifices by which one deterritorialized element serves as new territoriality for another

**Hand, Breast, Body, and Tool: Facilized in the Novel**
- Relative deterritorializations (transcoding) reterritorialize on absolute deterritorialization (overcoding).

---

### Origins and Implications

**The Concept of Facialization**

**Definition:**
- The abstract machine of faciality is a process that turns objects or body parts into faces
- Triggered by power dynamics, not individual faces

**Examples:**
1. Maternal power during nursing
2. Passional power in love
3. Political power with leaders
4. Power of film and television
5. Primitives societies: no faciality, operate through bodies instead

**Characteristics of Facialization:**
1. Not a universal concept (White Man or Christ)
2. Two aspects:
   a. Constitutes facial units (man or woman, rich or poor)
   b. Selective response: chooses which faces pass or not
3. Black hole acts as central computer, moving across the "white wall" or surface of reference
4. Produces individualized faces based on units and combinations
5. Rejects non-conforming faces at different levels of choice
6. Involves power dynamics, not ideology
7. Facialization is a form of biunivocalization (binarization)
8. Not limited to humans: becomings-animal involve animal spirits taking possession of bodies instead of faces.

---

### Racism, Deviance, and the Production of Identities

**The White Wall Expands**
- The white wall is always expanding
- The black hole functions repeatedly
- The teacher has gone mad, but madness is a face conforming to the "th choice" (not the last)
- A ha. It's not a man and it's not a woman, so it must be a transvestite
- The binary relation is between the no of the first category and the yes of the following category, which under certain conditions may mark a tolerance as easily as indicate an enemy to be mowed down at all costs

**Faciality Machine as Deviance Detector**
- Facility machine does not restrict itself to individual cases but operates in a general fashion
- If the face is in fact Christ, the first deviances, the first divergence-types, are racial: yellow man, black man, men in the second or third category
- They must be Christianized, in other words, facialized
- European racism as the white man's claim never operates by exclusion or designation of someone as Other
- It instead inserts degrees of deviance in relation to the White-Man face, attempting to integrate nonconforming traits into increasingly eccentric and backward waves

**Racism and Faciality Machine**
- Racism does not detect particles of the other; it propagates waves of sameness until those who resist identification have been wiped out or tolerated at a given degree
- Painting has exploited all resources of the Christ-face to produce every kind of facial unit and every degree of deviance
- The facialization of the body and landscapification of all milieus were presided over by Christ
- The most prodigious strokes of madness appear on canvas under the auspices of the Catholic code

**Information Theory and Faciality Machine**
- Information theory takes as its point of departure a homogeneous set of ready-made signifying messages that are already functioning as elements in biunivocal relationships or the elements organized into biunivocally
- The picking of a combination depends on a certain number of subjective binary choices that increase proportionally to the number of elements
- However, this requires the deployment of a wall or screen and the installation of a central computing hole without which no message would be discernible and no choice could be implemented
- The faciality machine provides a protective screen and a computing black hole, as well as faces that draw arborescences and dichotomies without which the signifying and subjective would not function
- Facial biunivocalities and binaeries double the others; facial redundancies are in redundancy with signifying and subjective redundancies
- The face depends on an abstract machine that does not assume a preexistent subject or signifier, but provides the substance necessary to them

**Triggering the Faciality Machine**
- The faciality machine is not in operation all the time or in just any social formation
- Certain social formations need face and landscape

---

### The Facility Machine and the Crushing of Polyvocality

**The Emergence of Significance and Subjectivity in Language**

**Generalized Collapse of Primitive Semiotics:**
- Heterogeneous, polyvocal primitive semiotics replaced by a semiotic of signifiance and subjectification
- Both prevail over each other but crush polyvocality, set up language as exclusive expression, and operate through biunivocalization and subjective binarization

**Semiotic Systems in Conflict:**
- Different semiotics wage war on one another using their own weapons
- Linguistics encounters the problem of homonymy or ambiguous statements and reduces them to binary reductions
- Linguistics cannot tolerate polyvocality or rhizome traits; a child unable to concentrate on language and writing will never be a good subject

**Power Assemblages:**
- Specific assemblages of power impose signifiance and subjectification as their determinate form of expression
- Reciprocal presupposition between despotic and authoritarian assemblages of power, new contents, signifiance, and subjectivity
- Imperialism of the new semiotic system: crushes other semiotics, protects itself against threats

**Bodily Discipline:**
- Destruction of the body and corporeal coordinates through which multidimensional or polyvocal semiotics operated
- Bodies disciplined, corporeality dismantled, becoming-animal hounded out, deterritorialization pushed to a new threshold
- Construction of a landscape, reterritorialization on the face, decoding of the body, overcoding by the face

**Faciality Machine:**
- Social production of the face and facialization of entire body and surroundings
- Reterritorialization on the face, decoding of the body, collapse of corporeal coordinates or milieus implies constitution of a landscape
- Face is a politics: no unitary function; masks assure head's belonging to the body or construct the face itself as an abstraction or operation.

**Significance and Subjectivity:**
- Distinct principles, regimes, and apparatuses of power
- Mixture leads to imperialism in which both systems endeavor to crush all other semiotics
- Signifiance interpenetrates with subjectivity; white wall/black hole machine provides a solid foundation for the mixture.

---

### Despotic and Passional Faces in Literature and Art

**Characteristics of Two Limit-Figures of the Face:**

**Despot/Terrestrial Signifying Face:**
- Black holes distribute and multiply on white wall
- White wall reduces to crest or horizon thread, hurtling towards black hole
- Both elements go together but in different modes: either distribution of black holes or reduction of wall
- Surrounded by a border or multiple borders that expand surface or intensify line
- Dead eyes that see all the better for being in a black hole

**Passional Authoritarian Face:**
- White wall reduces to crest or horizon thread, coiling around black hole
- Black hole is surrounded by a border or multiple borders
- Eyes are always inside the hole: dead eyes which see all the better
- Two figures of destiny, two states of faciality machine
- Common characteristics include both elements going together but in different modes and the presence of a border around black hole.

---

### A Comparative Analysis of Perspectives on Life and Art

**The French Novel vs. Anglo-American Novel**

**French Novel**:
- Concerned with measuring the wall or building it
- Plumbs the depths of black holes and composes faces
- Profoundly pessimistic and idealistic, critical of life rather than creative of it
- Stuffs characters down the hole and bounces them off the wall
- Can only conceive of organized voyages and salvation through art

**Anglo-American Novel**:
- Tries to get away, out, break through, make a beeline
- Finds the line of separation, follows it or creates it
- Has a different approach to other civilizations, the Orient or South America, drugs and voyages in place
- Knows how difficult it is to get out of the black hole of subjectivity, of consciousness and memory, of the couple and conjugality

**The Black Hole and the Face**
- The French novel's organization of the face holds faciality traits and places them at the service of signification and subjectification
- Tics are a battle between faciality traits trying to escape and the facial organization that clamps down on them
- Dismantling the face is a major affair, as it involves real becomings and positive deterritorialization, not just art

**Schizoanalysis: Find Your Black Holes and White Walls**
- It's impossible to return to a presignifying and presubjective semiotics or play the role of primitive peoples
- We will always find ourselves reterritorialized again if we try to stay an artist and hate life, rather than facing out the rest of our lives

---

### Transcending Humanity through Inhumanities and Rhizomatic Deterritorialization

**Impasses of Signification**
- White wall of signifier: impasse for understanding
- Black hole of subjectivity: personal experiences, emotions
- Facial machine: expresses and conceals emotions

**Leaving the Impasse**
- Abstract machine: deterritorializes and creates new abstract machines
  - Deterritorializations: relative or absolute
    * Relative: break down strata
    * Absolute: create on a plane of consistency
  - Faciality machine: defacialization frees facial traits, forming rhizomes with other freed traits

**Inhumanities**
- Primitive inhumanity: polyvocal semiotic system, deterritorialized relatively
- Post-facial inhumanity: probe-heads, positive and absolute deterritorializations
  * Cutting edges of deterritorialization
  * Forms new becomings, nonhuman life

**Contrasting Inhumanities**
- Primitive head: spiritual, human connection to body
- Post-facial inhumanity: probe-heads, cutting edges of deterritorialization

**Implications**
- Embrace the post-facial inhumanity for a nonhuman life creation
- Leave behind the primitive head's limitations and nostalgia.

## 8. 1874: Three Novellas, or 'What Happened?

**The Novella as a Literary Genre**

**Characteristics of the Novella**:
- Organized around the question: "What happened?" or "Whatever could have happened?"
- Opposite of the tale, which asks: "What is going to happen?"
- Integrates elements of both tales and novels into the perpetual living present (duration)

**Distinction from Tales and Novels**:
- Something that has happened in a novella remains unknown or unknowable
- Requires minute attention and precision on the author's part
- Reader experiences two "bated breaths": 
  - In the novella, we expect something to have just happened
  - In tales, we wait for something to happen

**Relationship to Secrecy and Body Posture**:
- Novellas have a fundamental relation to secrecy, not the secret object but the form of secrecy
- Barbey d'Aurevilly's fondness for body posture in his novellas
- Posture is like inverse suspense, unlike tales with their focus on discovery

**Links of the Novella**:
- What happened? (modality or expression)
- Secrecy (form)
- Body Posture (content)

**Fitzgerald as a Novel and Novella Writer**:
- Fitzgerald's genius lies in asking "What could have happened?"
- Not a question of memory, reflection, old age, or fatigue
- Rather, an affair of perception: seeing something already there or over

**The Universality of the Novella**:
- We are made up of lines, not just writing lines
- The novella has its own way of giving revelation to these lines

---

### Rigid and Supple
or
"Exploring the Interplay of Macro and Micro Politics in Henry James's 'In the Cage'"

**The Novella "In the Cage" by Marcel Arland**

**Character Analysis**:
- The heroine is a young telegrapher with a clear-cut, calculated life
- Her telegraphist's cage is contiguous to her fiancé's grocery store
- The fiancé is constantly plotting their future

**Rigid Segmentarity**:
- Our lives are made up of segmented elements (States, institutions, classes) and people
- This allows for control and identity of each agency, including personal identity
- The fiancé can say they have the same tastes and are alike despite their different segments

**Molecular Segmentation**:
- A new line of molecular or supple segmentation emerges
- It is a "line of deterritorialization" where the segments are like quanta of deterritorialization
- This line coexists with the rigid segmentarity, constantly interfering with each other

**The Heroine's Transformation**:
- The heroine reaches a "maximum quantum in her supple segmentarity"
- She attains a kind of "absolute deterritorialization" and cannot interpret anything anymore
- This is the "third type" of line, an "exploding of the two segmentary series"

---

### Breaks, Cracks, and Ruptures in Fitzgerald's 'The Crack-up'

**The Telegraphic Line and Fitzgerald's Crack-up:**
* Three types of segmentarity in a person's life: rigid, molecular, abstract
* Rigid segmentarity: age, wealth, succession of finite segments (Fitzgerald's voyages no longer useful due to aging, loss of wealth, etc.)
* Molecular segmentarity: micro-cracks, subtle changes in desire and desire redistribution (occur without notice)
* Abstract line: immanence of rhizome with segmentations of a different nature
* Clean break: rupture that makes past cease to exist, irreversible (Fitzgerald contrasts it with structural pseudobreaks)

**Rigid Segmentarity:**
- Age and aging process
- Loss of wealth or success
- Failed conjugality
- Rise of fascism and Stalinism
- Cinema era
- Alcoholism

**Molecular Segmentarity:**
- Micro-cracks in immanence of rhizome
- Changes in desire
- Redistribution of desires

**Abstract Line:**
- Not a symbol or simple line, intermingles with other lines
- Rhizomatic instead of arborescent segmentations
- Micropolitics

**Clean Break:**
- Rupture beyond return (irretrievable)
- Contrasted with structural pseudobreaks in signifying chains
- No more secrets or grasps, drawing own territories
- Becoming imperceptible and clandestine
- Deterritorialization: becoming like everybody/the whole world.

---

### The Perspective of Near-Seers and Far-Seers

**The Line of Rigid Segmentarity with Molar Breaks**
- Segments encircle an abyss, like a "huge black hole"
- Two types of lookouts: near-seers and far-seers

**Near-Seers**
- Simple spyglass for seeing outlines of binary divisions, dichotomies, well-defined segments (classroom, barracks, low-income housing project, countryside)
- Use a "terrible Ray Telescope" to cut out shapes and restore molar order
- Geometrical instrument emits a laser beam to overcode everything in pure geometry as a State affair

**Far-Seers**
- Long-distance vision with complex and refined telescopes
- See microsegmentarity: details of details, lines or vibrations that start to form before shapes appear
- Perceive a rhizome, molecular segmentation that cannot be overcoded by a signifier or attributed to a figure/aggregate/element
- Can divine the future as a becoming of something already happened in molecular matter
- Observe subtle infractions and movements not seen by others
- Feel ambiguous towards the damage caused by the cutting telescope, but unable to predict its use

**Lines of Flight or Rupture (Molecular Segmentation)**
- Different from rigid segmentarity and overcoding
- Inseparable from anonymous segmentation that challenges everything without goal or reason
- Perception goes hand in hand with semiotics, practice, politics, theory; one sees, speaks, and thinks according to a given line (connectable or not)
- Lines are imposed, sprout up by chance, or can be invented; difficult to invent lines of flight

**Examples of Lines:**
- Lines of children leaving school at a run vs. demonstrators chased by the police
- Different animal lines of flight for each species and individual
- Fernand Deligny distinguishes lines of drift and customary lines in walking, perception, gestures (cooking or collecting wood), and language

**The Line of Flight or Rupture (Molecular Segmentation)**
- Constantly crossing, intersecting for a moment, following one another.

---

### Schizoanalysis and the Interplay of Segmentarity and Flight

**Lines of Segmentarity**
- Intersection between a customary line and a child's behavior results in:
  - Child losing/finding something
  - Rapid hand movements causing emissions of several lines
- Lines of segmentarity:
  - Line of drift (complex, with singularities)
  - Customary or molar line (segments)
  - Molecular line (quanta causing it to tip)

**Lines of Segmentarity vs. Language and Structure**
- Lines have no connection to language or the determination of a subject by signifier
- Signifier arises at rigidified level, subject at lowest level
- Not related to structure; never occupies closed system

**Lines of Segmentarity and Desire (Schizoanalysis)**
- Analysis of desire is practical and political for individuals, groups, or society
- Schizoanalysis focuses on lineaments in groups and individuals
- Precedes being, practice participates in drawing lines

**Characteristics of Lines of Segmentarity**
- Rigid segments: socially determined but not imaginary
- Supple segmentation: real and extensive as micropolitics
- Line of flight: personal, dangerous for societies, creates new weapons

**Importance and Combinations of Lines of Segmentarity**
- Can begin with rigid segmentality or line of flight
- Alliances and battles between lines possible
- No assurance compatibility between two lines of flight
- Mutual immanence of the lines: no transcendent lines, each is at work within others.

### The Case of Chekhov and Fitzgerald

**Problems and Dangers in Segmentarity Lines:**

**Rigid Segmentarity:**
- Slim chances of failure in rigidification
- No much to say about danger or ambiguity

**Supple Segmentarity:**
- Ambiguity of danger
- Line of flight imbued with despair and joy

**Line of Flight:**
- Threatening core, death or demolition
- Despair despite message of joy
- Possible mixtures and passages between lines

**Chekhov's Characters:**
- Struggle and overexertion leading to despair?
- Carrying love despite grim characters
- Lines composing essential parts of Novella (la Nouvelle) and Good News (la Bonne Nouvelle)

**Fitzgerald's Relationship:**
- Both parties destroyed but not each other
- Line of family and friends, judgments
- Supple segmentation: alcoholic and madwoman extract double at limit
- Line of flight: clandestine of one another, sharing line, new acceptance or happiness?

## 9. 1933: Micropolitics and Segmentarity Segmentarities (Overview of the Types)

**Segmentarity: An Overview of Different Types**

**Segmentarity**: Segmentation inherent to various aspects of life, including dwelling, getting around, working, and playing. Humans are "segmented" in binary, circular, and linear ways.

**Binary Segmentation**: Opposition between social classes, men vs women, adults vs children.

**Circular Segmentation**: Segments organized in larger circles or coronas, with distinct activities occurring in each corona. This is transversally divided into smaller segments based on kinship groups and lineages.

**Linear Segmentation**: Segments arranged along a straight line, representing episodes or proceedings. We constantly transition from one segment to another.

**Segmentarity in Primitive Societies**: Characterized by polyvocal codes based on lineages and their varying situations, itinerant territoriality based on local divisions, and a fabric of supple segmentation.

**Segmentarity in Modern State Societies**: Centralization is often seen as the opposite of segmentarity, but this distinction may be biologically deep down. The modern political system is unified yet juxtaposed with imbricated subsystems. Bureaucracy operates by compartmentalized offices and goal displacements. Hierarchy is not pyramidal; the boss's office can be at the end of the hall as well as on top of the tower.

**Binary Oppositions in Modern Societies**: Stronger than primitive societies, often resulting from self-sufficient binary machines with biunivocal relationships and successive binarized choices. Classes and sexes come in twos, leading to tripartition.

**Circular Segmentation in Modern Societies**: Centers act as knots, eyes, or black holes that may not resonate together and have different centers. The shaman's role is to collect all centers on a single circle with a single center, creating centralized power and arborescent systems.

---

### From Primitive Societies to Modern States

**Segmentary vs. Centralized Power**

**Characteristics of Rigid Segmentarity:**
- Localized power based on particular segments
- Dependent upon drugs or drugs
- Each point emits independent sequences
- Opposed to modern societies and states, but concentric
- Replaces supple microheads with a macroface
- Power centers still exist, act as resonance apparatuses

**Transition from Primitive Societies to Modern States:**
- Homogeneous and isotropic space overcodes lineal segments
- Distinct focal points begin to resonate in a center
- Rigid segmentarity loses dynamic relation to segmentations-in-progress
- Geometry and arithmetic replace supple morphological formations
- Private property implies overcoded, gridded space

**Abstract Machines:**
- Primitive societies operate by codes and territorialities
- Difference between tribal system of territories and clan system of lineages
- Modern societies replace declining codes with univocal overcoding
- Overcoding results in specific reterritorialization in an overcoded geometrical space

**Molar vs. Molecular Segmentarity:**
- Primitive societies have nuclei of rigidity or arborification
- Every society and individual have both molar and molecular segmentarities
- Distinct but inseparable processes, coexist and cross over into each other.

---

### The Molecular Segmentarity and Micropolitics of Desire

**Theory of Bureaucracy and Fascism:**
- **Reciprocal Presupposition**: Classes crystallize masses but there is a difference in viewpoint, nature, scale, and function between them.
- **Bureaucracy**: Not only rigid segmentarity with compartmentalization of offices, office manager, and centralization at the top. Also includes suppleness, communication between offices, bureaucratic perversion, and permanent inventiveness or creativity.
- **Fascism**: Implies a molecular regime that is distinct from molar segments and their centralization. Coexistent with segmentation and totalization of rigid segments but defined by microfocuses in interaction.
- **Microfascisms**: Proliferate in every niche, giving fascist determination to desire, even after establishment of National Socialist State.
- **Dangers of Fascism:** Dangerous due to molecular or micropolitical power; a mass movement rather than totalitarian organism. Easy for leftist organizations to secret microfascisms.
- **Errors to Avoid:** Believing that suppleness alone is enough, confusing molecular with psychological realm, assuming only size difference between molar and molecular forms, ignoring proportional relation between the two.
- **Molecular vs. Molar Segmentation**: The stronger the molar organization, the more it induces a molecularization of its elements; molecular movements do not complement but rather thwart and break through great worldwide organization.
- **Society Definition**: Societies defined by contradictions on larger scale, but from micropolitics perspective, societies are defined by lines of flight or escapes from binary organizations.

---

### Molar vs. Molecular Dynamics

**Molar vs. Molecular: Understanding Power and Flows**

**Background:**
- France's May '68 events baffled many due to unaccountable factors escaping macropolitical understanding
- Gabriel Tarde's insights on peasants in southern France provide insight into unraveling molar and molecular organizations

**Molar Organization vs. Molecular Composition:**
- Line and segment used for molar organization, but more suitable words needed for molecular composition
- Power centers at border between line and flow
- Examples: monetary flows with segments vs. financing-money with poles, quanta (inflation, deflation)

**Power in Molar vs. Molecular:**
- Relative power to regulate communication, conversion, coadaptation of two parts of circuit
- Power centers defined by what escapes them or their impotence

**Characteristics of Molecular/Microeconomics:**
- Small elements but nature of mass is quantum flow
- Adjusting segments to quanta requires hit-and-miss changes in rhythm and mode
- Something always escapes

**Examples:**
1. Church power: segmented administration of sin vs. molecular flow of sinfulness
2. Criminality: molar line of legal code vs. quantum flow of criminality
3. Military power: segmented war corresponding to States waging war vs. pure flow of absolute war
4. Tarde's work and influence: countered Durkheim's macrofocus on collective representations with interest in subrepresentative matter (microimitation, oppositions, inventions)
5. Flow as belief or desire in every assemblage.

### Decoding, Deterritorialization, and Conjugation in History

**Beliefs and Desires vs. Representations**

**Beliefs and Desires**:
- Basis of every society
- Flows that are quantifiable and can be marked by "quanta"
- Create, exhausted, or transformed, added to one another, subtracted or combined

**Representations**:
- Large-scale aggregates or determine segments on a line
- Overcoded lines with reterritorializations

**Decoding and Deterritorialization vs. Overcoding and Reterritorialization**
- Decoding/deterritorialization: eludes codes, marks flow quanta
- Overcoding/reterritorialization: arrests flow, prevents it from flowing further
- Inverse relationship, but complementary and coexistent

**Example: Original Sin**
- Act of decoding in relation to creation (with one last preserved island)
- Deterritorialization in relation to the land of Adam
- Overcoding by binary organizations and resonance (Powers, Church, empires, rich-poor, men-women)
- Complementary reterritorializations (on the land of Cain, on work, reproduction, money)

**Social Fields**
- Animated by decoding/deterritorialization movements affecting masses and operating at different speeds and paces
- Every social field is a question of mass (e.g., 10th to 14th centuries: acceleration of factors of decoding and deterritorialization)

**Connection vs. Conjugation of Flows**
- **Connection**: Boosting, accelerating, augmenting decoded flows
- **Conjugation/Accumulation**: Stopping, plugging, sealing lines of flight, performing reterritorialization
- Deterritorialized flow brings about the accumulation or conjunction of processes and overcoding

**Historian's Role**
- Distinguish between molecular aspect (masses, flows, mutations) and molar aspect (classes, segments, binary organization)
- Macrohistory vs. Microhistory: Different systems of reference, not about length of durations considered

---

### Lines of Overcoding, Flows, and Deterritorialization

**Three Kinds of Lines:**
* Line of interlaced codes and territorialities: primitive segmentarity, social space constituted by segmentations
* Rigid line: brings about dualist organization, concentricity of circles, generalized overcoding; implies State apparatus
* Lines of flight: marked by quanta and defined by decoding and deterritorialization (war machines)

**Coexistence and Transformation:**
* Three lines coexist but transform into one another
* Lines illustrated in example of different groups, applies more to cases with all lines within a single group or individual

**Abstract Machines:**
* Overcoding machine: defines rigid segmentarity, reproduces segments, creates divisible space striated in all directions, linked to State apparatus but not equated with it
* Mutation machine: operates by decoding and deterritorialization, steers quantum flows, assures connection-creation of flows, erects war machines on lines.

**Power Centers:**
* Power centers involve rigid segments
* No contradiction between segmentary parts and centralized apparatus: common central point acts as resonance on the horizon behind all other points.

---

### Hierarchy, Segmentarity, and the Microtextures of Power

**The State: A Resonance Chamber for Segments and Centers**
- The State is not a point taking all others upon itself but a resonance chamber
- Even under totalitarian regimes, the function of resonating distinct centers and segments remains unchanged
- Centralization always hierarchical, but hierarchy is segmentary

**Centralization: Hierarchical and Segmentary**
- Each power center exercises power on a micrological fabric
- Power centers are always molecular and exist only as diffuse, dispersed, geared down, miniaturized, perpetually displaced
- Power centers have a molar side (official or overcoding line) and a molecular side (molecular Klamms or workers)

**Power Centers: Translating Flows into Segments**
- Power centers function at the points where flows are converted into segments
- They extract power from their impotence in governing flows, not just segments
- Centralized powers like banking and finance govern conversions between different kinds of money or value

**Power and Impotence: Complementary Forces**
- The only great Statesmen connect with flows and emit quanta that escape the "black holes" of segmented lines
- There is no Power regulating the growth of monetary mass or money supply
- Centralized powers are exchangers, converters, oscillators, not governors of flows themselves.

#### "Understanding the Dangers and Transformative Potential of the Power Center in Human Experience"

**Power Centers and Dangers**

**Three Power Centers**:
- First zone: Defined by State apparatus, overcoding abstract machine
- Second zone: Molecular fabric immersing first zone
- Third zone: Abstract machine of mutation, flows, and quanta

**Dangers of the Lines**:
- Fear: Loss of security, molar organization, binary logic
- Clarity: Distinctions in what seemed full, supple segmentarity dangers
- Power: Stabilizing mutation machine in overcoding machine, creating voids and impotence
- **Fourth Danger**: Lines of flight themselves, emanating despair, danger of immolation

**Fear**:
- Loss of security, desired molar organization, binary logic
- Reassuring rigid segmentarity

**Clarity**:
- Distinctions in fullness, supple segmentarity dangers
- Reproducing rigid affectations or creating microfascisms

**Power (Pouvoir)**:
- Stretches between rigid and fine segments, immersed in mutant flows
- Creating voids, trapping and stabilizing mutation machine in overcoding machine

**Fourth Danger**:
- Lines of flight emanate despair, distinct from previous dangers
- Immolation state of war, returning broken.

---

### Destruction and Abolition

**The Dangers of Desire**

**Self-Immolation**:
- Something "sodden-dark" and destructive
- Crossing walls, entering "black holes"
- Turning lines of flight into lines of destruction

**The War Machine vs. the State Apparatus**:
- The war machine is a nomadic force directed against the state apparatus
- The state seeks to appropriate this war machine and make it part of its own apparatus
- When the war machine becomes focused on destruction, it can lead to "total war" and the "suicide of the state"

**Fascism vs. Totalitarianism**:
- Fascism involves a war machine taking over the state, rather than a state army seizing power
- Totalitarianism is conservative and aims to seal all lines of flight
- Fascism is more "suicidal" in its willingness to engage in destructive actions and even sacrifice itself

**The Dangers of Desire**:
- The danger lies not just in the transformation of lines of flight into lines of destruction, but also in the possibility that desire itself may become a source of destruction
- The "passion of abolition" can lead to the "suicide of the state" as well as personal self-immolation

## 10. 173 0: Becoming-Intense, Becoming-Animal, Becoming-Imperceptible

**Becoming-Intense, Becoming-Animal, Becoming-Imperceptible**

**Willard (1972)**
- Movie about a man named Willard who lives with his authoritarian mother
- Mother orders him to destroy a litter of rats; he spares one
- After a violent argument, mother dies and house is coveted by a businessman
- Willard likes the intelligent rat he saved, Ben, and his white female companion
- Spends all free time with rat pack, but follows them into danger at work
- Tries to remain among humans, but rats attack him in the basement

**Themes of Becoming-Animal**
- **Becoming-animal not content to proceed by resemblance**: Ben, the favorite rat, leads a pack that undermines human structures like family and career
- **Proliferation of rats, the pack**: brings a becoming-molecular that disrupts signifying projects and constitutes a nonhuman sexuality
- **Sinister choice with a favorite in the pack**: represents a hideous pact or contract of alliance with the rat
- **Institution of an assemblage, a war machine or criminal machine**: can reach the point of self-destruction
- **Circulation of impersonal affects, alternate current that disrupts signifying projects and subjective feelings**: disrupts human attempts at reterritorialization

**Natural History vs. Evolutionism**
- Natural history was concerned with relationships between animals, not evolution by filiation like later evolutionism
- Evolutionism began with the genealogical motif, while natural history focused on sum and value of differences or resemblances

**Analogy in Natural History**
- Two types of analogy: series and structure
- **Series**: A resembles B, B resembles C, etc., requires imagination to account for branchings and degrees of modification
- **Structure**: A is to B as C is to D, realizes perfection through equivalent relationships, requires understanding to define independent variables and correlates within each structure
- Both series and structure ideas coexisted in natural history, with mimetic/mimological vision of Nature

**Legacy of Ideas**
- Relationships between animals are not only scientific but also part of dreams, symbolism, art, practice, man-animal relations, and human sciences.

---

### A Comparative Analysis of Jung, Bachelard, and Structuralism

**History of Ideas and Archetypes**
- The history of ideas should not be continuous; it should examine thresholds, journeys, and transformations of ideas (progression-regression)
- Collective imagination or social understanding applied to man-animal relationships based on objective relationships between animals
- Jung's theory of Archetype as collective unconscious: assigns animals a crucial role in dreams, myths, human collectivities
- Animal is inseparable from series with double aspect of progression and regression
- Approach to dream integration based on archetypal series (feminine, masculine, infantile, animal)
- Man may become an animal for certain acts or functions

**Structuralism vs. Archetypes**
- Structuralism denounced prestige of imagination and serial organization in favor of symbolic understanding
- Ordering differences to arrive at correspondences between human groups and their totem animals (Man-Crow, Warrior-Wolf)
- Symbolic understanding replaces analogy of proportion with analogy of proportionality, series with structure, identification with equality of relations
- Structuralism denies existence of special becomings-animal that traverse humans and affect the animal as well (vampires)
- Becoming is not correspondence between relations or resemblance/imitation; it produces nothing other than itself
- Becoming animal does not make human become an animal or vice versa.

---

### Animals, Multiplicity, and the Human Experience

**The Nature of Becoming**

**Becoming vs Fixed Terms**:
- Real is the becoming itself, the "block of becoming"
- The term "becoming-animal" is valid even when the animal form is not present
- The "becoming-other" of an animal is real, even if the resulting form is not present

**Characteristics of Becoming**:
- Lacks a distinct subject from itself
- Has no term, as its term exists only within another becoming
- Forms a "block of becoming" with other related beings and processes

**Becoming vs Evolution by Descent**:
- **Becoming is not an evolution by descent and filiation**
- All filiation is imaginary; becoming is of a different order than filiation
- Becoming involves **alliances**, especially between heterogeneous entities

**Neoevolutionism**:
- Defines animals by their populations rather than characteristics
- Involves transversal communications between heterogeneous populations
- **Becoming is "involu-tionary", not evolutionary or regressive**

**The Animal as a Band or Pack**:
- Animals are fundamentally a band, pack, or population
- The human being encounters the animal as part of a multiplicity
- The fascination with the pack is related to a multiplicity within the self

**Unnatural Participations and Suicides**:
- Writer's "unnatural participations" and "unusual nuptials" can lead to suicides
- Writers are sorcerers because they experience the animal as the only population before which they are responsible in principle.

---

### Packs, Contagion, and Becomings-Animal

**Animals in Psychoanalysis:**
- Invite regression and narcissistic contemplation (understood only by psychoanalysis)
- Two types: pets and pack/swarm animals
- Animals as pets: treated individually, focus on personal characteristics
  - Cats, dogs, sheepherder's favorite animal in the pack
- Animals as pack/swarm: multiplicity, becoming, population
  - Contagion and epidemics as forms of propagation
    * Unlike heredity or filiation, propagation by contagion involves heterogeneous terms (human, animal, bacterium)
    * Unnatural participations or nuptials between different species
- Three ways to treat animals: characteristics, archetypes, models
  * Jung delves deeper than Freud
- Borges' Manual de zoologíafantástica and A Universal History of Infamy missed the concept of pack animals and their contagious propagation.

**Contagion vs Filiation:**
- Contagion: epidemic, battlefields, catastrophes, interkingdoms (unnatural participations)
  * Propagation through epidemics rather than filiation
  * Involves heterogeneous terms (human, animal, bacterium)
  - Examples: vampires, werewolves, truffle hunting, hybrids
- Filiation: hereditary reproduction, sexual production

**Pack Animals:**
- Multiplicity without ancestor or filiation
- Human beings effect their becomings-animal through these dark assemblages
  * Hunting societies, war societies, secret societies, crime societies
  - Contagion stirs what is deepest within us.

**Animals in War:**
- Man of war: upsets filiations and classifications
  * External to families and States
  * Power of affect, metamorphosis, treason
- Animals in battle or trail battles and take advantage of them
  - Cats seen on the battlefield.

**Different States:**
- Pack animals: integrated into family institutions, State apparatuses, war machines (differences in nature)
- Writing machine, musical machine to becomings-animal?

#### "Exploring the Role of the Anomalous in Animal Multiplicities"

**Anomalous vs. Anormal**
- **anomalous**: refers to unequal, coarse, rough, cutting edge of deterritorialization (Greek)
- **abnormal**: lacks a noun in French and refers to that which is outside rules or goes against the rules (Latin)

**Anomalous vs. Exceptional Individual**
- Anomalous is not simply an exceptional individual or pet
- Anomalous has no specific or generic characteristics, nor is it a model or unique specimen
- Anomalous is not the bearer of a species in purest state or perfection of a type incarnate
- Anomalous is not the eminent term of a series or the basis of an absolutely harmonious correspondence

**Anomalous as Bordering Phenomenon**
- A multiplicity is defined by its lines and dimensions (intension) rather than elements or characteristics (extension)
- The borderline, or anomalous, is not a center but the encompassing line or farthest dimension
- The anomalous position can be occupied by an individual or fascinated Self in relation to the pack or multiplicity it borders

**Classification System for Packs**
- Understanding the various positions of the anomalous and the pack requires avoiding an evolutionism that sees them as inferior collective stages
- Each animal may reach the line or occupy a dynamic position at the boundary of the pack, such as a leader of the pack

---

#### "Exploring the Role of Alliance and Anomaly in Sorcery and Becoming-Animal"

**The Borderline Between Pack and Anomalous Beings**

**Defining the Borderline**:
- Defined or doubled by a being of another nature that no longer belongs to the pack, or never did
- Represents a power of another order, potentially acting as a threat and trainer, outsider, etc.
- No band is without this phenomenon of bordering or anomaly

**Forces Undermining the Band**:
- Extremely varied forces that establish internal centers of conjugal, familial, or State types
- Make the band pass into an entirely different form of sociability
- Replace pack affects with family feelings or State intelligibilities
- Evolutionism sees this as "progress" and can also affect human bands

**Sorcerers**:
- Always hold the anomalous position at the edge of the village or between villages
- Have an affinity with alliance, not filiation, which gives them a status opposed to that of filiation
- Their relation is one of **alliance**, not filiation

**Sexuality and Sorcery**:
- Two types of curses:
  - Sexuality as process of filiation transmitting original sin
  - Sexuality as power of alliance inspiring illicit unions or abominable loves
- Demon does not have the ability to procreate, so must adopt indirect means like being a succubus/incubus

**Alliance and Contagion/Pact and Epidemic**:
- Sorcerer belongs first of all to a group united by alliance, not filiation
- Evolution of sorcery based on how alliance acquires permanence or assumes political weight

**Becoming-Animal in Minoritarian Groups**:
- Becomings-animal expresses minoritarian groups, prohibited, in revolt, or always on the fringe
- Politics of becomings-animal is ambiguous, but can be co-opted by central institutions

**Importance of Becomings-Animal**:
- Not just important to consider becoming-animal, but various other becomings (woman, child)

---

#### "Exploring the Concept of Becoming and Multiplicity in Deleuze and Guattari's Thought"

**Becoming and Multiplicity**

**Concepts:**
- Becomings: elementary, cellular, molecular, imperceptible
- Ultimate regions of a continuum inhabited by unnameable waves and unfindable particles
- Evolution in science fiction from animal to becomings-molecular and imperceptible
- Music content plied by becomings-woman, child, animal
- Becoming-molecular takes over where becoming-animal leaves off
- Initiatory journeys include thresholds and doors where becoming itself becomes
- Symbiosis of heterogeneous elements composing a multiplicity

**Examples:**
- Wolf-Man's pack of wolves, swarm of bees, collection of small holes and tiny ulcerations (contagion)
- Man totters from one door to the next and disappears into thin air: fluid, luminous beings made of fibers
- Initiatory journeys: howling of animals to wailing of elements and particles
- Packs transforming themselves into each other, cross over into each other
- Werewolves become vampires when they die

**Multiplicity:**
- Not defined by its elements or center of unification/comprehension
- Defined by the number of dimensions it has
- No dividable, cannot lose or gain a dimension without changing nature
- Each multiplicity is composed of heterogeneous terms in symbiosis
- Continually transforming itself into a string of other multiplicities

**Anomalous and Outsider:**
- Borders each multiplicity, determines temporary stability
- Precondition for alliance necessary to becoming
- Carries transformations of becoming or crossings of multiplicities

**Order vs. Alogical Consistencies:**
- No logical order to string, crossings or transformations
- Each multiplicity is symbiotic; its becoming ties together various heterogeneities (animals, plants, microorganisms, mad particles, galaxy)
- Sorcery codifies certain transformations of becomings
- No preformed logical order between heterogeneities (wolf-multiplicity and hair-multiplicity)
- Line of flight: let itself get bogged down or turn into a line of abolition?

**Schizoanalysis/Pragmatics:**
- Make a rhizome.

---

### The Intersection of Multiplicities and Abstract Machines in Literature and Philosophy

**Rhizome and Becomings**

**Experimenting with Becomings**
- No preformed logical order for becomings and multiplicities
- Importance of applying criteria during events to guide through dangers
- Plane of consistency: intersects all concrete forms, gathers dimensions, prevents bogging down or veering into void

**Multiplicities and Dimensions**
- Plane of consistency cuts across all multiplicities with any number of dimensions
- Each becoming reaches the point where it can flatten and conserve all its dimensions on the plane of consistency
- Imperceptible becomings seen and heard on the plane of consistency (Planomenon, Rhizosphere, Criterium)

**Waves as Vibrations on Plane of Consistency**
- Each character in "The Waves" intermingles multiplicities, advances like a wave
- Abstract Wave: all characters' vibrations propagate following a line of flight or deterritorialization

**Transformation vs. Local Movements**
- Human beings cannot become animal in reality (essential forms are inalienable)
- Demonic reality of becoming-animal of human being through local transports
- Transports cross no barriers: essential forms, substances, or subjects

**Accidental Forms and Individuals**
- Susceptible to more or less: charitable, white, warm
- Degree of heat is an individual (Haecceity) entering composition with other degrees
- Intensities have latitude consisting of composable individuations
- Participation in accidental form implies a flutter, vibration not reducible to properties of a subject

---

### A Plane of Consistency

**Spinozist Perspective on Individuation and Unity of Nature**
- **Rejection of Substantial or Essential Forms**: Spinoza critiques essential forms as finite elements endowed with form; instead, there are abstract, infinitely small parts of actual infinity that belong to an individual based on their degree of speed or relation to movement and rest.
- **Infinitely Small Parts of Actual Infinity**: These parts are not defined by number but by composition of relations. Each individual is an infinite multiplicity, and the whole of nature is a multiplicity of perfectly individuated multiplicities.
- **Plane of Consistency or Composition**: The plane of consistency includes all forms of life, whether inanimate or animate, artificial or natural. It has no connection to form or figure; instead, it's the intersection of all forms and machine of all functions.
- **Unity of Plane**: The unity of this plane is not based on a ground, end, or project but a fixed yet real and individual abstract machine where everything is laid out. It's a univocal world where every difference expresses itself with one meaning.

**Comparison Between Cuvier and Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire**
- **Cuvier**: Focused on relations between organs and functions, taking analogy to the scientific stage as an analogy of proportionality. Unity is a unity of analogy which cannot be realized without fragmentation into distinct branches.
- **Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire**: Went beyond organs and functions to abstract elements (anatomical) that enter various combinations, forming a given organ and assuming a function based on their degree of speed or slowness. Speed and slowness subordinate not only forms but types of development.

**Impact on Evolutionary Thought**
- **Tachygenesis and Differential Rates of Growth**: Species as kinematic entities that are either precocious or retarded, with a pure plane of immanence where unformed elements dance based on their speed. Even failures are part of this plane.

**Little Hans Example**
- Child's understanding of "peepee-maker" is not based on organ or function but material that varies according to its connections, relations of movement and rest, entering different assemblages for boys and girls.

---

### Understanding Bodies through Affects and Relations

**Children's Understanding of Organ Concepts**
- Children have difficulty defining an organ due to its various functions and appearances (bone, engine, excrement, etc.)
- Organ experience is not animistic or mechanical but universal machinism: a plane of consistency occupied by infinite assemblages
- Questions asked by children are poorly understood without acknowledging their question-machines and indefinite articles

**Spinozism and Ethics**
- Every relation of movement and rest has corresponding power degree
- Memories of Spinoza: longitude (particle aggregates) vs latitude (affects)
- A body is defined by its affects, not organs or functions
- Ethology: studying an animal's active and passive affects in their context
- Tick example: three affects determine its behavior within the assemblage of its individual parts
- Children approach animals with a list of affects rather than species/genus characteristics

**Children's Understanding of Animals vs Adult Perception**
- Children's perception is not imitation, pity, or sympathy but understanding how an animal can endure and express itself through its affects
- Becoming-animal: Little Hans becoming a horse, Hofmannsthal's rat becoming thought
- Unnatural participation: rat gnashing teeth in man's death throes

**Slepian's Problem of Becoming Dog**
- Imitation and analogy are not solutions to becoming a dog
- Endowing body parts with new relations to create an original assemblage for dog transformation
- Artifice of shoes: wearing them on hands creates a new relation between elements, resulting in affect or becoming.

---

### The Failure and Success of Transformation

**Psychoanalysis and Becoming-Animal**

**Slepian's Plan(e)**:
- Attempted to force the tail into a relationship with the sexual organ and caudal appendage, so that they would become part of a new assemblage
- The plan failed because the tail remained an organ of the man and an appendage of the dog, their relations did not enter into composition in the new assemblage

**Psychoanalytic Drift**:
- Psychoanalysis often confronts the question of becoming-animal in children and masochism
- Psychoanalysts (e.g., Freud, Ferenczi) focused on symbolic analogies between relations rather than understanding the reality of becoming-animal
- They saw the animal as a representative or representation, not as affect in itself

**Limitations of Psychoanalysis**:
- Psychoanalysis alone is not enough to bring about the breakage of becoming-animal
- There is always the danger of "playing the animal," even in memories and stories

**Haecceities: A Different Mode of Individuation**

- A body is defined by its longitude (material elements) and latitude (intensive affects)
- Haecceities are individuations different from person, subject, thing, or substance
- Examples include seasons, hours, and intensive experiences like heat
- In the Orient, more individuations by haecceity than subjectivity or substantiality

---

### The Plane of Consistency and Its Unique Temporality

**Key Points about Haecceities:**
- Individuation of a life vs individuation of the subject supporting it
- Two planes: consistency/composition (haecceities) and forms/substances/subjects
- Aeon: indefinite time of event, floating line, simultaneous too-late and too-early
- Chronos: time of measure, situates things and persons, develops form, determines subject

**Haecceities vs Subjects:**
- Not oversimplified conciliation between formed subjects and spatiotemporal coordinates
- Entire assemblage is a haecceity (longitude, latitude, speeds, slownesses)
- Climate, wind, season, hour are part of assemblages

**Expression in the Plane of Consistency:**
- Proper names, verbs in infinitive or indefinite articles/pronouns form basic chain
- Infinitive verb expresses floating time (Aeon) and articulates speeds and slownesses
- Proper name does not indicate subject but something of the order of event or becoming.

**Haecceities vs Other Modes:**
- Oppose infinitive as mode/tense of becoming to other modes/tenses that pertain to Chronos
- Infinitive is an expression of Aeon, articulating relative speeds and slownesses independently of chronometric values.

---

### Haecceities, Assemblages, and the Unformed

**Two Conceptions of the Plane:**

**The Structural/Genetic Plane of Organization and Development:**
- Hidden principle necessary for forms and subjects
- Always inferred, never given
- Teleological plan of transcendence
  * Assigns eminent term or proportional relations of a structure
  * Operates as a mental principle
  - Can be in the mind of a god or unconscious of an entity
  - Described but ungiven in that to which it gives rise
- Examples: Life plan, music plan, writing plan

**The Consistency/Composition Plane:**
- No forms or developments of forms, nor subjects or formation of subjects
- Only relations of movement and rest between unformed elements (molecules, particles)
- Haecceities form according to compositions of nonsubjectified powers or affects
- Things arrive late or early and constitute collective assemblages based on speed compositions.

---

#### "Exploring the Immanent Plane of Consistency in Literature and Art"

**The Plane of Consistency or Composition**
- Not tied to a mental design but an abstract one
- Number of dimensions continually increases as what happens happens
- Loses nothing of its planitude
- A plane of proliferation, peopling, contagion
- Proliferation of material has nothing to do with evolution or filiation of forms
- Involution: form is constantly being dissolved, freeing times and speeds
- Fixed sound plane: freeing time, Aeon, nonpulsed time for floating music
- Modern musicians oppose the transcendent plane of organization to the immanent sound plane
- Same applies to fixed visual plane in Godard's cinema

**Two Planes of Writing**
- Transcendent plane that organizes and develops forms/subjects
- Plane that liberates particles of anonymous matter, allowing communication through relations of movement and rest

**Comparison between Two Types of Propositions**
1. Forms develop and subjects form as a function of a plan(e) that can only be inferred (planfe] of organization-development)
2. There are only speeds and slownesses between unformed elements, and affects between nonsubjectified powers, as a function of a plane that is necessarily given at the same time as that to which it gives rise (the plane of consistency or composition)

**Examples from 19th Century German Literature:**
- Holderlin: Hyperion - Importance of haecceities of the season type, dissolving forms and persons, giving rise to movements, speeds, delays, and affects.
- Kleist: Everything becomes speed and slowness; succession of catatonic freezes and extreme velocities; no form develops or subject forms; affects are displaced, becomings catapult forward and combine into blocks.
- Nietzsche: Criticizes Wagner for retaining too much harmonic form and too many pedagogical personages; Zarathustra and Ecce Homo have only individuations by haecceities.

**The Failure of the Plane(s) but Integral Part of the Plan(e)**
- The plane will always fail, but failures are an integral part of the plan(e).

#### "Exploring the Planes of Organization and Consistency in Music and Life"

**The Relationship Between the Two Kinds of Planes: Stratification vs. Consistency**

**Stratification**:
- Forms and subjects, organs and functions, are strata or relations between strata
- The plane of organization or development effectively covers stratification

**Consistency/Immanence**:
- Implies a destratification of all of Nature
- Pure relations of speed and slowness between particles imply movements of deterritorialization
- Pure affects imply an enterprise of desubjectification
- The plane of consistency does not preexist the movements of deterritorialization that unravel it
- The plane of organization is constantly working to plug the lines of flight, stop or interrupt the movements of deterritorialization

**Challenges with the Planes**:
- Preventing the plane of consistency from becoming a pure plane of abolition or death
- Retaining a minimum of strata, forms and functions, a minimal subject to extract materials, affects, and assemblages

**Music as an Example**:
- Western music implies a minimum of sound forms and even melodic/harmonic functions
- Speeds and slownesses are made to pass across these forms
- Beethoven's polyphonic richness through scanty themes
- Ravel and Debussy retain just enough form to shatter it

**Individuation vs. Haecceity**:
- Proust showed that individuation proceeds not by subjectivity but by haecceity, pure relations of speeds and slownesses
- Swann thought in terms of subjects, forms, resemblances, correspondences
- The narrator is on a different plane, focusing on molecular speed and unbearable distance/proximity with Albertine

**The Narrator's Pose**:
- Not principally that of the investigating detective but that of the jailer
- Trying to become master of speed, stand it nervously (as a headache) and perceptually (as a flash)
- Trying to build a prison for Albertine

---

### The Transformative Power of Jealousy, Music, and Animalism in Proust and Deleuze

**Proust's Perception of Music and Jealousy**
- Proust's perception of music:
  - Vinteuil gradually ceases to be apprehended in terms of forms and comparable subjects
  - Assumes incredible speeds and slownesses on the "plane of consistency of variation" (the plane of music and the Recherche)
- Jealousy is different for Swann and the narrator
  - Swann's efforts to reterritorialize the flow of things are replaced by the "sped-up movement of deterritorialization"
  - This sweeps away faces, landscapes, love, jealousy, painting, and music itself
  - For the narrator, despite partial victories, fails in his project to become master of speeds to the rhythm of his asthma

**Becoming-Animal as One of Many Becomings**
- Becoming-animal is one of many becomings: becoming-woman, becoming-child, becoming-vegetable/mineral
- These becomings are connected by "fibers" that lead from one to another
- Singing or composing, painting, writing aim to unleash these becomings
  - Especially music: traversed by becoming-woman, becoming-child
  - Instrumentation and orchestration permeated by becomings-animal (especially becomings-bird)
  - Molecular discordances have always been present, even if instrumental evolution makes them more important
- Becomings-animal plunge into becomings-molecular

**The Principle of Proximity in Becoming**
- Becoming is not to imitate or identify with something/someone, nor to proportion formal relations
- It is to extract particles and establish the relations of movement and rest that are closest to what one is becoming
- This principle of proximity indicates a zone of proximity or copresence of a particle
- It marks a belonging to the same molecule, independently of subjects/forms considered
- Scherer and Hocquenghem's reconsideration of "wolf-children" case
  - Not about real transformation into animal, imitation, or symbolic metaphor
  - Child's reality of becoming-animal, even without actually becoming animal
  - Child's "inhuman connivance with the animal" and creative involutions outside the programmed body

---

### The Molecular Nature of Transformation

**Becoming-Animal and Molecularity**

**Understanding Becoming-Animal**
- Not about changing molar species or imitating animals
- Becoming-animal occurs molecularly through emitting corpuscles that enter the relation of movement and rest of animal particles
- Man does not become wolf, vampire, etc., but creates a molecular animal through proximity to emitted particles
- Importance of imitation in some contexts, but not the sole aspect of becoming-animal

**Becoming-Woman**
- Not about transforming into a molar woman entity
- Becoming-woman is producing "molecular woman" by emitting particles that create a relation with femininity
- Necessary for women to conduct molar politics, but dangerous to confine oneself to it
- Importance of molecular women's politics that slips into molar confrontations and passes under or through them
- Writing can produce becoming-woman by impregnating social field with particles of womanhood
- Reconstruction of the body as "Body without Organs" is inseparable from a becoming-woman or production of molecular woman.

**Girl's Becoming**
- Girl's becoming is stolen to create opposites and impose history, organism, or subject on her
- The girl serves as an example and trap for boys to fabricate their own opposed organisms and histories
- Conversely, the reconstruction of the body as "Body without Organs" is inseparable from a becoming-woman or production of molecular woman.
- Girls do not belong to an age group, sex, order, or kingdom; they slip in everywhere, between orders, acts, ages, and sexes; producing n molecular sexes on the line of flight in relation to dualism machines.

---

### The Role of the Feminine in Transformation and Warfare

**The Girl and Becoming-Woman**

**The Girl as Becoming-Woman**:
- The girl is like a "block of becoming" that remains contemporaneous to each opposable term, man, woman, child, adult.
- It's not the girl who becomes a woman; it's **becoming-woman** that produces the universal girl.
- The girl and the child do not become; they draw their strength from the **becoming-molecular** they cause between sexes and ages.

**The Man of War and Becoming-Animal**
- The man of war disguises himself as a woman, hides as a girl.
- This is not a shameful, transitory incident; it's a warrior function to attract the enemy and traverse something.
- The **becoming-woman of the warrior** and the **becoming-animal of the former** occur in an "asymmetrical block of becoming" in which they are transformed in an "instantaneous zigzag".

**Sexuality and Becomings-Animal**
- Sexuality brings into play too great a diversity of conjugated becomings; these are like "n sexes", an entire war machine through which love passes.
- **Becoming-animal** is a reality that extracts a shared element from the animal, not just imitation or utilization.

**Becoming-Imperceptible**
- Becoming-imperceptible is the cosmic formula of becoming, the end toward which all molecular becomings strive.
- To become imperceptible means many things: to be like everybody else, to go unnoticed.

---

### Imperceptibility, Indiscernibility, and Impersonality in the Cosmos

**Becoming Everybody/Everything**
- Becoming everybody/everything requires asceticism, sobriety, and creative involution
- Eliminate waste, death, superfluity, complaint, grievance, unsatisfied desire, defense or pleading to blend in with the world
- By conjugating and continuing with other lines, pieces, one makes a world that can overlay the first, like a transparency
- Animal elegance, camouflage fish, clandestine: become imperceptible by blending with surroundings
- Poets do not pursue resemblance or calculate geometric proportions, but retain essential lines and movements of nature
- To be present at the dawn of the world, find proximities and zones of indiscernibility

**Imperceptibility, Indiscernibility, Impersonality: Three Virtues**
- Reduce oneself to an abstract line, a trait to find zone of indiscernibility with other traits
- Enter haecceity and impersonality of the creator by combining indefinite article, infinitive-becoming, proper name
- Movement has essential relation to imperceptible, exists above and below perception threshold
- Perception can only grasp movement as displacement or form development
- Reach photographic or cinematic threshold to perceive movement and affect

**Movement and Perception: Two Planes**
- Relative thresholds of perception play role in mediating distribution of percepts and forms
- Principle of composition or deterritorialization must be perceived on plane of immanence or consistency
- Jumping from relative to absolute threshold allows imperceptible to become perceived
- Kierkegaard's knight of faith continually imparts, reimparts, and gathers the finite, perceiving the imperceptible.

### A Rhizomatic Approach to Perception and Desire

**The Problem of Drugs: A Discourse on Perception and Causality**

**Perception as Limitation**
- Presence of one haecceity in another
- Prehension of one by the other or passage from one to another
- Movements are key

**Faith, Drugs, and Becoming**
- Faith: plane that works by immanence
- Knights of narcotics: drugs as a means of accessing the plane of becoming
- Concerns speeds and modifications of speed

**The American Dream and Drugs**
- Americans between genocide of Indians and slavery of blacks
- Constructed psychically repressed image of black as force of affect
- Socially repressed image of Indian as subtlety of perception

**European Perspective on Drugs**
- Henri Michaux: willing to free himself from rites and civilizations
- Minute protocols of experience, delimiting drugs from delirium and hallucination

**The Problem Formulated Correctly**
- Elimination of forms and persons
- Mad speeds of drugs and extraordinary posthigh slownesses
- Perception molecularized, able to grasp microperceptions and operations

**Critique of General Causalities**
- Incapable of grasping specific causality in extension
- Pretending to understand without understanding the phenomenon

**Psychoanalysis as Model, Contrast, and Betrayal**
- Constructed schema of specific causality divorced from generalities
- Unconscious as a plane of transcendence opposed to perception-consciousness system
- Imperceptible remains imperceptible due to unconscious's dualistic nature

**The Plane of Consistency or Immanence**
- Necessarily perceived in its own right during construction
- Experimentation replaces interpretation, microperceptions given
- Desire directly invests the field of perception, where the imperceptible appears as object of desire

**Drugs and the Immanent Plane of Consistency**
- Drugs provide immanence and plane that psychoanalysis botched
- Question if drugs actually draw necessary plane for their action
- Segmentarization under rigid forms, like dependency and dosage.

---

### A Perceptual and Immanent Perspective

**The Relationship Between Drug Addiction and the Plane of Consistency**

**Dangers of Drug Addiction:**
- **Betrayal or throwing off track**: other causalities intervene in drug assemblages, leading to dangers on the plane of consistency.
- **Self-destructive behaviors**: drug addicts create "black holes" and "lines of death," which dismantle the plane at the same time they construct it.

**Drug Addicts as Precursors or Experimenters:**
- Drug addicts may be considered as precursors or experimenters who blaze new paths of life, but their cautiousness lacks the foundation for caution.
- They join the legion of false heroes following a conformist path, or resume and benefit from the aborted plane of drugs.

**Mistakes Drug Users Make:**
- Continually starting over again, either going on the drug again or quitting, rather than making it a stopover and starting from the middle.
- Attempting to succeed in getting drunk or high on pure water instead of focusing on the right molecule.

**The Importance of Choosing the Right Molecule:**
- The vital assemblage, life-assemblage, is theoretically possible with all kinds of molecules, but not machinically possible with silicon.
- Machinic reasons are different from logical reasons or possibilities; one straddles the right horse by choosing the right molecule.

**The Secret as Content:**
- The secret relates to certain contents that are too big for their form or have a covered, doubled, or replaced simple container.
- Perception of the secret is a part of it, even if the perception seeks to denounce, finalize disclosure, or disclose the secret.

**The Secret as Secretion:**
- The way in which the secret imposes itself and spreads is also shrouded in secrecy.

---

### Influence, Perception, and Transformation

**Secrets and War Machines:**
* Secrets are not static notions but have a "becoming"
* Originate in war machine, which brings about influence, pressure, and non-disclosure
* Involve both secret perception and mode of action (influence or doubling)

**Characteristics of Secret Societies:**
* Protection and equalization
* Silence and hierarchy
* Ritual and centralization
* Autonomy and compartmentalization

**Role of Influence and Doubling:**
* Every secret society has a "hindsociety" for perception, protection or punishment
* Mode of action can be influence, creeping, insinuation, oozing, pressure, or invisible rays
* Secret societies act by influencing public figures and doubling with hindsocieties

**Paranoid Conception of the Secret:**
* Psychoanalysis moved from hysterical to paranoid conception of the secret
* Unconscious as infinite form of secrecy instead of a box containing secrets
* Ultimately, nothing happened; the secret became insignificant and disappeared

**Gender Differences in Handling Secrets:**
* Women handle secrets differently than men
* Transparency, innocence, and speed can hide information effectively
* Celerity versus gravity: women's secrets are often more politic than men's.

---

### Transcending Content and Form in Literature

**The Secret Reaches Its Ultimate State: Molecularization and Linearization**

**Henry James' Evolution in Dealing with Secrets**:
- Initially sought secrets in contents, even insignificant ones
- Raised the possibility of an infinite form of secrecy that has conquered the imperceptible
- Asked whether the secret is in content or form, but answered neither

**The Three States of Secrets**:
- Child's content
- Virile infinite form
- Pure feminine line

**Becoming-Minoritarian vs. Becoming-Man**:
- Man is majoritarian, while becomings are minoritarian
- Majority implies a state of domination
- Women, children, animals, plants, and molecules are minoritarian
- Becoming-woman is necessary for all to become-minoritarian
- Deterritorialization of the subject (man) from majority identity and the medium (minority) that rises up

**Political Nature of Becoming-Minoritarian**:
- Not a macropolitics issue, but an active micropolitics labor of power
- Opposed to winning or obtaining a majority in history
- Every becoming is a block of coexistence, not conceptualized by past and future.

---

### Understanding Becomings and the Line-System of Becoming

**Arborescence vs. Becoming**

**Arborescence**:
- Man constitutes himself as a "gigantic memory" through the position of the central point, its frequency, and its resonance
- Any line connecting molar (distant or contiguous) points is defined by these conditions of frequency and resonance, part of the arborescent system
- Arborescence is the submission of the line to the central point

**Becoming**:
- Not defined by points it connects or composes, but passes between points, comes up through the middle, transversally to localizable relations to distant or contiguous points
- Has neither beginning nor end, departure nor arrival, origin nor destination; only a middle
- Fast motion, the absolute speed of movement in the middle
- Indifferent to both contiguity and distance
- Unites two asymmetrical movements into a shared deterritorialization, forming a "line of flight or descent" between the points
- Opposed to memory, as becoming is an antimemory that frees the line from the point and renders points indiscernible

**Contrast with Memory**:
- Memories always have a reterritorialization function
- A vector of deterritorialization is directly plugged into molecular levels and becomes stronger as it becomes more deterritorialized

**Punctual vs. Block Systems**:
- Punctual system includes linear coordinates and refers to the flow of time (kinematics) and order of time (stratigraphy)
- Musical representation draws a horizontal, melodic line and a vertical, harmonic plane that runs from high to low, defining a chord capable of linking up with following chords.

---

### From Punctual to Multilinear

**Characteristics of Punctual Systems:**
- Based on two base lines: horizontal and vertical
- Serve as coordinates for assigning points
- Horizontal line can be superposed vertically, vertical line horizontally
- Points are produced or reproduced under conditions of horizontal frequency and vertical resonance
- Lines (or diagonals) connect points of different levels or moments
- Arborescent, mnemonic, molar, structural systems
- Punctual history-memory systems

**Opposition to Punctual Systems:**
- Linear or multilinear systems
- Free the line and diagonal
- Musicians/painters aim to snap or send a tremor through punctual system
- History made by those who oppose it, not those who insert themselves into it
- Transhistorical act of creation detached from task of representing world
- Nietzsche's Untimely: subhistorical or superhistorical, becoming, forgetting, geography, map, rhizome

**Examples:**
- Boulez as historian of music
- Viennese school and diagonal line-block
- Mozart's microblocks

**Characteristics of Multilinear Systems:**
- Everything happens at once: line breaks free of point as origin; diagonal breaks free of vertical and horizontal as coordinates; transversal breaks free of diagonal as a localizable connection between two points.
- Sound block propelled by its own nonlocalizable middle (milieu)
- Intermezzo: body without organs, antimemory pervading musical organization.

#### "The Transformative Power of Lines and Refrains in Schumann's Music and Art"

**Schumannian Body and Bifurcations**
- Schumannian body: knows only bifurcations, doesn't construct itself, diverges according to an accumulation of interludes
- Schumannian beating: panic but coded; not perceived due to staying within the limits of a docile language

**Tonality and Contradictions**
- Two contradictory tonalities: a screen (articulates body according to known organization) and a servant (becomes ready for beats on another level)

**Painting: Line and Diagonals**
- Point doesn't make line; line sweeps away point, carries it off under its outside influence
- Line runs between points in a different direction that renders them indiscernible
- Diagonal has broken free from vertical and horizontal, becoming transversal or curve
- Line has no origin, coordinates, or localizable connection
- Abstract line creates creative functions again as color-point or line-point

**Perspective: Reterritorialization of Lines of Flight**
- Perspective is only a historical manner of occupying diagonals, reterritorializing lines of flight
- Lines of flight invent possibility of representation, but are quickly reterritorialized
- Central perspective plunges multiplicity of escapes and dynamism into a punctual black hole
- Creative lines released when mastery claimed over them

**Music: Becoming as Intense as That of Music**
- Block of becoming in expression rests on transversals that continually escape from coordinates or punctual systems
- Content essential to music: a child dies, a child plays, woman born/dies, bird arrives/flies off
- Musical expression is inseparable from becoming-woman, becoming-child, becoming-animal
- Refrain as musical content: anxiety, fear, joy, love, work, walking, territory... but refrain itself is music's content
- Motif of refrain may be various emotions but refrain itself is music's essence
- Refrain prevents or wards off music rather than originating it.

---

### Deterritorialization and Transformation

**Music vs. Painting:**
* Both arts involve refrains, but with different approaches and problems
* Painting: deterritorialization of faces and landscapes through corporeality, faciality, or colors/lines
* Music: deterritorializing the refrain, inventing lines of deterritorialization for it
* No clear distinction between animals and humans in terms of painting and music capabilities
* Difference between noise and sound is not a definitive basis for distinguishing music from other sounds

**The Problem of Music:**
* Refrain is central issue in music
* Deterritorializing the refrain through procedures and constructions different from painting
* Stronger deterritorializing force compared to painting
* Collective fascination and potential danger due to its powerful bonding effect on people

**The Problem of Painting:**
* Three states: semiotic systems, face-landscape organization, deterritorialization of faces and landscapes
* Deterritorialization can be achieved through reactivation of corporeality or liberation of lines or colors
* Many becomings in painting, including animal, woman, child
* Not clear when painting begins versus animals, but aim has always been deterritorialization of faces and landscapes.

**Comparison between Music and Painting:**
* Difficult to line up the two problems without an extrinsic criterion (e.g., material conditions or collective force)
* Music seems to have a stronger deterritorializing force with greater intensity and collective effect compared to painting.

---

### Music, Becoming-Animal, and the Deterritorialization of Art

**Relationship Between Painting and Music**

**Background:**
- Differences in correspondences between pictorial machine and musical machine
- Klee's observation of a "backwardness" of painting compared to music
- Preference for painting over music due to less intimidation

**Factors to Consider:**
1. **Relative territorialities**: Painting and music have different territories, which result in different deterritorializations and reterritorializations.
2. **Animal refrains**: Territorial vs. deterritorialized through music
3. **Machining of the voice**: Deterritorialization and becoming-woman or child within music
4. **Becoming-animal in music**: Mozart's bird-themed music, transformation into something absolute
5. **Imitation vs. Becoming**
   - No art is imitative or figurative
   - Pure line, color, and sound in painting and music
6. **Double becoming:** Block formation, Mondrian's perfect square, Hitchcock's "Birds"
7. **Tarantella dance**: Magical cure for supposed tarantula bite; patient becomes a dancing spider and spider becomes sound and color.
8. **Imitation vs. Becoming:** Adjustment of the block as a finishing touch, but the real transformation occurs in the becoming-spider of the dance.
9. **Impact on Arts and Life**: The tarantella dance and Moby-Dick effect show that becoming is always double; pure lived experience of both parties involved.

---

### A Deleuzian Perspective

**Alexis the Trotter:**
- Famous for imitating a horse through various means, including racing and playing harmonica
- Harmonica considered his "chops-destroyer"
- Played harmonica twice as fast as others, with a nonhuman tempo
- Called his harmonica his "bit," reflecting the horse's bit in its sound

**Qualities and Becoming:**
- Pure qualities no longer seen as punctual systems or archetypes
- Function of quality considered from the standpoint of becoming it supports
- Whiteness of Moby Dick's whale an index of its becoming-solitary
- Colors, silhouettes, and animal refrains indicators of becoming-animal or social

**Double Deterritorialization:**
- Deterritorialization always double: major and minor variables in simultaneous becoming
- Non-symmetrical deterritorialization has deter-ritorializing force and deterritorialized force
- Content and expression form an asymmetrical block, with indiscernibility created through deterritorialization
- Different assemblages have varying speeds and indices of deterritorialization

**Fernandez's Analysis:**
- Voice ceases to be machined for itself in opera
- Music crosses new threshold of deterritorialization with orchestration and instrumentation
- Lied marks first appearance of pure movement placing voice and piano on same plane
- Verdi's opera remains lyrical despite destruction of bel canto and importance of orchestration.

---

#### "The Molecularization of Music and Becoming in Deleuze and Guattari's Philosophy"

**Topic: Musical Deterritorialization and Becoming-Molecular**

**Background:**
- Music serves as a foundation for new molecular flows
- Dualist system of sexes in music is a coordinating system
- Principal problem: voice becoming-molecular instead of woman or child

**Molar Systems in Music**
- Foundation for new molecular flows
- Voices reterritorialized on distribution of sexes
- Continuous sound flow passes between sexes as difference of potential

**Second Point: Voice Becoming-Molecular**
- Intense focus on Debussy's works and Wagner's music
- Aquaticism or atomization of motif through orchestration
- Birds replaced by insects: drums, violins, guitars, etc.
- Molecular vibrations in place of vocal birds

**Becoming-Animal:**
- Birds and insects both important but instrumentalization prevails
- Replacement of becoming-bird with becoming-insect or a block
- Closer connection to truth that all becomings are molecular

**Messiaen's Discoveries in Music:**
- Power of deterritorialization permeating nature, animals, elements, and human beings
- Universe made up of refrains: cosmic and elementary power
- Human beings not at an advantage due to overcoding or punctual systems
- Nonmusical sound of human beings forms a block with becoming-music of sound.

**Conclusion:**
- Music dispatches molecular flows
- Power of music opposes machines of human beings, roar of factories and bombers
- Embrace of nonmusical sound and becoming-music for continuity.

## 11. 1837: Of the Refrain

**Paul Klee's "Twittering Machine" (1922)**
- The child in the dark sings to comfort himself and find orientation
- His song is a sketch of calm and stability in chaos, with elements of skipping, hastening/slowing pace
- The song itself is a transition from chaos to order, but remains fragile and at risk of disintegration

**Home: Organizing Space**
- Home does not preexist; it must be created by organizing a limited space
- Landmarks and marks are used for this purpose, to protect the germinal forces within
- Sonorous or vocal components (e.g., wall of sound, humming) help organize and protect the interior

**Joining with Forces of the Future: Refrain as Territorial Assemblage**
- The refrain combines aspects of chaos, organization, and breakaway from chaos
- Paul Klee's "Twittering Machine" depicts these three aspects (gray point, dimensional space, launching out)
- The refrain is territorial, marking territory through bird songs or musical nomos
- It carries earth with it, has a relationship to a Natal/Native land, and is ethos (the Abode)

**Milieus and Rhythms: Protecting Against Chaos**
- Milieu: defined by periodic repetition of components; in perpetual state of transcoding or transduction
- Every milieu is open to chaos, which threatens exhaustion or intrusion
- Rhythm is the milieus' answer to chaos, as it provides a structure and organization to the in-between.

---

#### "Exploring the Rhythmic Nature of Transcodings and Territorialization in Milieus"

**Rhythm and Milieus:**
- Rhythm is not meter or cadence, but rather a communication between heterogeneous space-times (1)
- Rhythm exists in unequal or incommensurable passages from one milieu to another (2)
- Meter assumes a coded form with varying units of measure in noncommunicating milieus, while rhythm ties together critical moments and operates on different planes (3)

**Transcoding:**
- Transcoding occurs when a code takes or receives components that are coded differently (4)
- Examples: leaf-water relation, spider-fly relation (5)

**Territory:**
- A territory is an act that territorializes milieus and rhythms by affecting them (6)
- Milieu components become expressive in a territory instead of being directional or functional (7)
- The marking of a territory makes it dimensional but not a meter; the distinction between expressive marks and territorialized functions is crucial (8)

**Ambiguous Thesis:**
- Lorenz's thesis that aggression is the basis of the territory has little foundation, as it tends to make the territory a product of an intraspecific aggressive instinct. (9)

---

### Rhythm, Melody, and the Emergence of Art

**The Territorializing Factor and Expressiveness**

**Territorializing Factor**:
- Reorganization of function presupposes it
- Affects sexuality, hunting, building a place to live
- Organized or created because they are territorialized
- Seeked elsewhere: in the becoming-expressive of rhythm or melody
- Becoming expressive is called Art

**Property and Expressiveness**:
- Property derived from first person setting boundary stone or making mark
- Fundamentally artistic due to the emergence of expressive qualities
- Signatures, proper names, and chancy formations delineate a territory

**Expressive Qualities vs. Impulses and Circumstances**:
- **Expressiveness is not reducible to impulse-driven actions**
- Expressive qualities draw an objectivity in the territory they draw
- They have internal relations with one another, forming territorial motifs
- Autonomy of expression: expressive qualities entertain their own shifting relations
- Territorial counterpoints constitute points that place circumstances in counterpoint
- Relations between matters of expression express relations to impulses and circumstances

**Ritualization vs. Territorial Motifs and Counterpoints**:
- **Ritualization is not appropriate for nonpulsed motifs and nonlocalized counterpoints**
- Territorial motifs form rhythmic faces or characters
- Territorial counterpoints form melodic landscapes

---

### Motifs, Counterpoints, and Rhythms in Art and Nature

**Expressive Qualities and Music:**
* Entertain variable or constant relations with one another
* Not placards marking a territory, but motifs and counterpoints expressing interior impulses or exterior circumstances
* Musician bird adapts to rhythm, harmony, and melody
* Motifs and counterpoints create autodevelopment, forming a style (artistic discovery)

**Wagner's Leitmotifs:**
* Placards associated with situations, characters, impulses
* Transform into melodic landscapes and rhythmic characters
* Become autonomous from dramatic action, characters, landscapes, and environments
* Constantly evolve or remain constant

**Proust's Recherche:**
* Vinteuil's little phrases carry landscapes within themselves
* Discovery of melodic landscape and rhythmic character in art

**Lied as Musical Art:**
* Picture of Nature as a rhythmic character with infinite transformations
* Closely bound poles: melody (landscape) and rhythm (character)

**Mannerism:**
* Critical distance between beings of the same species
* Establishes distances, postures, steps, voices, etc.
* Schizophrenics communicate through laws of boundary and territory
* Artificial conditions for human art's appearance

**Effects of a Territory:**
* Reorganization of functions and regrouping of forces
* Creation or transformation of old functions into professional refrains
* Rules of critical distance for competition.

---

### The Interplay Between Forces and Spaces in Nature and Culture

**Territorialization and Art**

**Interspecific or Specialized Aggressiveness**:
- Territorialized aggression is a result of territorialization, rather than explaining it
- It organizes functions of the milieu into occupations and binds forces of chaos in rites and religions

**Religion and Territory**:
- Religion is present in the territorializing factor that allows for emergence of work function
- Territorialization groups all forces of different milieus together, attributing them to earth as receptacle or base

**Forces of Earth vs. Forces of Chaos**:
- In extension, territory separates interior forces of earth from exterior forces of chaos
- In intension (depth), both types of force clasp and are wed in a battle whose criterion is the earth
- There is always a place where all forces come together in hand-to-hand combat of energies

**Religion Depends on Territorializing Factor**:
- Religion, common to humans and animals, occupies territory due to its dependence on raw aesthetic and territorializing factor
- This factor organizes milieu functions into occupations and binds forces of chaos in rites and religions

**Decoding as Negative of Territory**:
- Decoding is the disjunction between territory and code, forming a free margin for variation
- Biologists highlight importance of determined margins (not mutations) in creating new species
- Territorialization establishes critical distance within same species, inducing differentiation

**Passages and Bridges**:
- Evolution is not the focus, but rather passage between milieus and assemblages
- Refrain moves towards territorial assemblage or leaves it
- Intra-assemblage includes both territorial and territorialized functions

---

### Deterritorialization and Interassemblage Relations

**The Territorial Assemblage and Deterritorialization:**
- Question: What holds together territorializing marks, motifs, and functions in the same assemblage?
- Consistency: Holding heterogeneous elements together
- First question interrupted by another: Function can acquire enough independence to constitute a new assemblage
- Courtship assemblage: Recognition independent of place; opens onto social assemblage
- Re-territorialization on member of couple or group with home value
- Movement from territorial to courtship/social assemblages
- Deterritorialized components: Operators, vectors, converters
- Passages between intra-assemblage and interassemblages
- Sexuality, aggressiveness, gregariousness can be territorialized or deterritorialized functions
- Profession, trade, specialty can territorialize activities but also take wing from the territory.

**Deterritorialization within Territorial Assemblage:**
- Innovative opening of territory onto female/group
- Variable relations between sexuality and territory
- Selective pressure through interassemblages
- Forces of deterritorialization affect territorial assemblage
- Two agents: grass stem, refrain (agents of passage and relay)
- Intra-assemblage inseparable from intra- and interassemblages.

**Examples of Deterritorialization:**
- Salmon: pilgrimages to source
- Supernumerary assemblies (locusts, chaffinches)
- Magnetic or solar-guided migrations
- Long marches (lobsters)
- Leaving all assemblages behind; entering another plane.

### Rhizomatic Functioning vs. Arboreal Schemas

**Deterritorialization and Assemblages:**
* Deterritorialization: movement of leaving a territory but without losing precision (can be relative)
* Three types of refrains:
	+ Territorial refrains: mark, assemble territory
	+ Functional refrains: assume specific function in an assemblage
	+ New assemblages: cause territory to pass into game assembly, which tends to become autonomous
* Consistency problem: how components hold together within and between assemblages
	+ Formalizing linear hierarchical model (Tinbergen's schema) not sufficient
* Rhizomatic functioning favored over arborification
**Deterritorialization:**
* Leaving a territory but not losing precision
* Can be relative, occurring in place
* Territory is constantly traversed by movements of deterritorialization
* Two grandiose cases: absolute deterritorialization while maintaining precision (Apocalypse)
* Deterritorialization may lead to reterritorialization (something that has the value of home)

**Refrains:**
* Classified as territorial, functional, or new assemblages
* Territorial refrains: mark, assemble territory
* Functional refrains: assume specific function in an assemblage
* New assemblages: cause territory to pass into game assembly, which tends to become autonomous

**Consistency Problem:**
* Holds for both components within a territorial assemblage and different assemblages
* May find conditions only on a cosmic plane where all heterogeneous elements convene
* Linear arborescent model not adequate due to dualisms (inhibition-release, innate-acquired)
* Factors suggest rhizomatic functioning: distribution of neurons, coordination between centers, oscillating molecules.

**Rhizomatic Functioning:**
* No form or correct structure imposed from outside or above but rather an articulation from within
* Interaction or coordination may be positive or negative, never direct as in linear relations
* Superposition of disparate rhythms, articulation of interrhythmicity.

### Intercalations and Articulations in Expression and Architecture

**Consolidation and Consistency:**
- The beginning always starts in between, with intercalated elements, intervals, and articulations of superposition
- Architecture attests to this consolidation through abodes and territories
- Reinforced concrete has allowed for architectural ensembles to free themselves from arborescent models
- Iron is intercalated following a rhythm in reinforced concrete
- The literary or musical work has an architecture, with Woolf's "Saturate every atom" and James' "begin far away"
- Consolidation is the terrestrial name for consistency
- Consolidation occurs through intercalary oscillators, interval analyzers, rhythm synchronizers

**Homogeneity:**
- Conditions of homogeneity: marks or matters of the same kind (e.g., song of a bird)
- Subsong vs. full song: subsong as placard, full song as style or motif
- Artificial isolation has different effects before vs. after acquisition of components of subsong

**Heterogeneities and Motifs:**
- Organization of qualified marks into motifs and counterpoints entails a taking on of consistency
- Consistency occurs between heterogeneities, not because it's the birth of differentiation but because heterogeneities become bound together through consolidation of coexistence and succession
- Machinic enunciations: varying relations of colors, sounds, gestures, movements, positions form machinic statements or assemblages tying together orders, species, and heterogeneous qualities.

**Stagemaker/Magic Bird:**
- Does not have a brightly colored plumage (potentially a compensation or prime factor)
- Songs can be heard from a great distance
- Uncovers yellow root of feathers while singing
- Complex motif interweaving own notes and those of other birds, producing consolidation through species-specific sounds, sounds of other species, leaf hue, throat color.

---

### Decoding Innateness and Territorializing Learning

**The Problem with Occupying Frequency Bands**
- The problem is not just about imitating songs, but occupying corresponding frequency bands
- In some circumstances, restricting oneself to a determinate zone may be advantageous
- Widening or deepening the zone can assure counterpoints and invent chords that would otherwise remain diffuse
- This is particularly relevant in the rain forest where many imitative birds are found

**Consistency of Expression**
- Matters of expression must be considered not only in relation to their aptitude to form motifs and counterpoints, but also in relation to inhibitors and releasers that act on them
- The mistake is to restrict oneself to a binary distribution of these factors
- Instead, we should start from a positive notion capable of accounting for the particular character the innate and acquired assume in the territorial assemblage
- This notion can only be arrived at in terms of assemblage, not behavior

**The Natal (Innate and Acquired)**
- The natal is the innate, but decoded; and the acquired, but territorialized
- It consists of a decoding of innateness and a territorialization of learning, one atop the other, one alongside each other
- The natal accounts for mixtures in territorial assemblage and interassemblages
- Behavior proves inadequate compared to the concept of assemblage

**Deterritorialization and Machines**
- Deterritorialization leads to machines being released, which can open up the deterritorialized assemblage to other assemblages or produce effects of closure
- Precocious or extremely sudden deterritorialization can lead to individual group effects spinning in circles
- Understanding phenomena of inhibition and breaking with the overnarrow inhibitor-releaser dualism is important.

#### "Exploring the Complex Relationship Between Black Holes, Consistency, and Life in Assemblages"

**Black Holes and Assemblages**
- Interassemblage may include lines of impoverishment and fixation leading to a "black hole" but can still lead into richer, more positive lines of deterritorialization (e.g., grass stem component among Australian grass finches)
- Black holes are machine effects in assemblages with complex relations to other effects:
  - Necessary for release of innovative processes? Catastrophic stases associated with crossroads behaviors
  - Closure of assemblage when black holes resonate or inhibitions conjugate: deterritorialization in the void
- Machines open/close an assemblage, including territorial assemblages (e.g., matter of expression) and vectors of deterritorialization
- Consistency of matters of expression relates to aptitude for forming melodic/rhythmic themes and power of the natal
- Black holes have special relation to molecular levels: semiotic components inseparable from material components

**Molar-Molecular Relations**
- Distinction between molar-molecular combinations:
  - Individual atoms can enter statistical accumulations, effacing individuality (molecule, macromolecule)
  - Retain individuality inside molecule/macromolecule, setting up direct communications between orders
- Not between individual and statistical, but populations; statistics concerns individual phenomena, antistatistical individuality operates in relation to molecular populations
- Distinction between group movements: one tends toward equilibrated, homogeneous states (divergent wave, delayed potential), other toward less probable concentration (convergent wave, anticipated potential)
- Intramolecular internal forces: covalent, arborescent, mechanical, linear relations; indirect, noncovalent, machinic, superlinear, nonlocalizable bonds

**Stratified Systems vs. Consistent Aggregates**
- Stratified systems/systems of stratification: horizontal linear causalities between elements, vertical hierarchies of order, framing forms
- Consistent, self-consistent aggregates: consolidations of heterogeneous elements, orders short-circuited or reversed, captures between materials and forces
- Life implies a gain in consistency (surplus value), destratifying from the outset
- Living thing performs transcoding of milieus, constituting stratum and effecting reverse causalities/transversals

**Territorial Assemblages**
- Decoding and deterritorialization inseparable from territorial assemblage (two new types of surplus value)
- Ethology demonstrates how varied components can crystallize into assemblages, transcending distinctions between orders and hierarchies.

---

### From Stratified Milieus to the Cosmos

**Assemblages vs. Milieus: The Cosmic Breakaway**

**Assemblages:**
- Defined by matters of expression, advanced determinisms, molecular combinations (noncovalent bonding)
- Swings between territorial closure and deterritorializing movement
- Examples: stagemaker's act of discerning both sides of a leaf, artist's creation process

**Milieus:**
- Stratified by form-substance relation or form-matter relation
- Organized on the plane of consistency
- Exist to organize chaos and create codes (baroque art)

**Classicism vs. Romanticism:**
- Classicism: organizes matter with a succession of forms, differentiates and orders parts
- Romanticism: territorializes, enters assemblages, identifies with the earth or foundation instead of creation

**Assemblage vs Milieu Opposition:**
- Relative opposition (milieus swing between stratification and destratification, assemblages swing between territorial closure and deterritorialization)
- Both involve imbrication of semiotic and material components

**Artistic Process:**
- Klee's cosmic breakaway: trying to fly from the earth, looking at microscopic levels, opening up to Cosmos for inspiration
- Classical artist organizes chaos by imposing forms on matter or creating codes in milieus
- Romantic artist territorializes and enters assemblages, identifies with foundation instead of creation.

---

### A Musical Perspective

**Disjunction between Earth and Territory**
- The Earth as an intense point in depth or projection (ratio essendi) is always in disjunction with the territory (ratio cognoscendi)
- The territory is German, the Earth Greek
- This disjunction determines the status of the romantic artist
- The artist experiences the territory as lost and themselves as an exile, a voyager, deterritorialized
- Yet this movement is still under earth's command, the repulsion from the territory is produced by the attraction of the earth

**Romantic Art vs. Classical Art**
- Romantic art no longer has substantial parts corresponding to forms or milieus corresponding to codes
- Form becomes a great form in continuous development, gathering forces of the Earth
- Matter itself ceases to be chaos and becomes moving matter of continuous variation
- The universal becomes a relation, variation, continuous variation of matter and form
- Assemblages placed matter and form in new relation: matter as expression, form as force

**The Hero in Romanticism**
- The hero is a hero of the Earth, mythic, rather than a hero of the People
- In Latin and Slavic countries, the earth is mediated by the people and exists only through them
- This time, the hero is related to the One-Crowd, not the One-All

**The Voice and Orchestration in Romantic Music**
- The vocal element acts as a subjectified individual with feelings
- This subjective vocal element is reflected in an orchestral and instrumental whole that mobilizes nonsubjective affects
- Orchestration-instrumentation brings sound forces together or separates them, gathers or disperses them
- Depending on whether the forces are of the Earth or People, of the One-All or One-Crowd, it imposes a given role on the voice and changes depending on which relation is internally confronted: universal or dividual.

---

### A New Approach to Music and Philosophy

**Concepts of One-Crowd vs. Dividual:**
- Two different conceptions of orchestration: sonorize Earth forces or People relations
- Wagner vs. Verdi: emphasis on voice, instrumentation, and orchestration
- Berlioz: passes between Sonorous Nature/People, molecular material harnessing forces
- Modern age focuses on cosmic forces rather than earthly matters

**Postromantic Turning Point:**
- Essential thing is not forms or matters but forces, densities, intensities
- Millet: peasant's weight essential; postromantic turning point: focus on nonvisible forces

**Consolidation of Material:**
- Problem is no longer beginning or foundation but consistency of material
- Debussy molecularizes sound matter to harness nonsonorous forces like Duration and Intensity

**The Age of Machine:**
- Varese's procedure: a musical machine of consistency, harnessing cosmic energy
- Synthesizer unites disparate elements and parameters in material synthesis

**Philosophy and Thought Synthesizer:**
- Modern philosophy tends to elaborate a material of thought to capture forces
- Synthesis is molecular and cosmic, not form and matter or ground

**Ambiguities of Overdoing It:**
- Too much in jumble: lapses into machine of reproduction instead of cosmicization
- Prepared piano as statistical heap; need calculated sobriety for deterritorialization and openness to something cosmic.

---

### The Role of the Artist in Cosmic Creation

**The Sobriety of Assemblages and Deterritorialization**

**Sobriety**:
- Necessary to make sound travel and project complex forms
- Involves pure and simple sound, without harmonics
- Proper technique is required for imagination

**Modern Figure vs. Child or Lunatic**:
- Not the child or lunatic, but cosmic artisan
- Homemade atomic bomb metaphor
- No longer artist, creator, or founder, but cosmic craftsman

**Material Characteristics**:
- Molecularized matter
- Relation to harnessed forces
- Consistency operations applied

**Earth and People's Relationship Change**:
- Deterritorialized earth: not just a point in a galaxy
- Molecularized people: a population of oscillators
- Artists discard romantic figures, relinquish earth and people

**Artist's Role Changed**:
- No longer a solitary figure
- Needs a people but states the people is lacking

**Three Ages (Classical, Romantic, Modern)**:
- Not an evolution or distinct breaks
- Enveloping different machines/relations to the Machine

**Forces and Rendering Visible/Sonorous**:
- Always about forces: chaos or earth
- Classical: destratification, decoding
- Romantic vs. modern: how forces are grasped (reflected in matter-form relations)

---

### A Sonic and Visual Exploration

**The Refrain: Sound and Deterritorialization**

**The Nature of the Refrain:**
- Sonorous par excellence, acts upon sound or light, extracting vibrations
- Catalytic function: increases speed of exchanges and reactions, assures indirect interactions between elements
- Essential aspects: augmentations and diminutions, additions and withdrawals, amplifications and eliminations by unequal values
- Retrograde motion running in both directions

**Refrain vs. Crystal:**
- Fabricates time, implied tense discussed by Gustave Guillaume
- Intrinsic quality and listener's state of force
- Can be associated with a character or landscape until it turns back on itself
- Poles: love, Odette, Bois de Boulogne or potentialities, other assemblages.

**Two Movements of Creation:**
1. Soma to germen
2. Germen to soma (painter's refrain vs musician's)

**The Power of Sound:**
- Strongest force of deterritorialization among artistic components
- Can effect both massive reterritorializations and ecstasy or hypnosis
- Musicians have a different relation to people, machines, and established powers.

**Milieu, Natal, Folk/Popular, Molecularized Refrains:**
1. Milieu refrains: two parts answering each other (piano and violin)
2. Natal refrains: territory-related refrains, disjunction between earth and territory (lullaby, drinking song, hunting song)
3. Folk/popular refrains: tied to an immense song of the people (Polish, Auvergnat, German, Magyar, Romanian)
4. Molecularized refrains: cosmic forces, tied to the Cosmos refrain (sea and wind).

**The Refrain as a Prism:**
- Extracts vibrations or decompositions from sound or light
- Assures indirect interactions between elements devoid of natural affinity
- Forms organized masses through amplifications and eliminations by unequal values.

**Refrain's Retrograde Motion:**
- Move from soma to germen or germen to soma (two movements of creation)
- Can be a closed circle with descriptive, indicative, or associative relations
- Impure crystals instead of pure crystal harnessing cosmic forces.

---

### From Territorial to Cosmic

**The Refrain as A Prior Form of Time**

**Music and Refrains**:
- Music does not eliminate bad or mediocre refrains, but uses them as a springboard
- Folk songs, bird songs, children's songs, drinking songs, Viennese waltz, cow bells: music uses anything and sweeps everything away

**Two Types of Refrains**:
1. **Territorial or Assemblage Refrain**: autonomous, self-sufficient, closed in upon themselves
2. **Cosmic Refrain**: the final end of music, a sound machine

**The Problem of Constructing New Chromaticism**:
- Beginning from popular and territorial melodies
- Creating new themes through development of Form or becoming of Forces
- Going from modality to untempered chromaticism, not suppressing tonality but turning it loose

**Creating the Cosmic Refrain**:
- Childhood scenes and children's games as starting point
- Becoming-child of the musician coupled with becoming-aerial or celestial
- Labor dedicated to first type of refrain creates second, more profound result: deterritorialized refrain in the Cosmos

**Dangers of Transition**:
- Black holes, closures, paralysis, auditory hallucinations
- Cosmic force already present in material, but strength required to handle it
- Schumann's madness and other potential risks

## 12. 1227: Treatise on Nomadology— The War Machine

**The War Machine vs. the State Apparatus**

**Axiom I: The War Machine is Exterior to the State Apparatus**
- Attested in mythology, epic, drama, and games
- Two poles of political sovereignty: magician-king (Rex) and jurist-priest (Juris-Priest)
  - Opposition but complementary, lack a mythology of conflict
  - State apparatus functions by distributing binary distinctions and forming interiority

**The War Machine vs. the State Apparatus**

**Characteristics of the War Machine:**
- Not reducible to the State apparatus or contained within it
- Originates outside, prior to the law: comes from elsewhere
- Ineffable multiplicity: furor against sovereignty, power against apparatus
- Witnesses to another kind of justice and relationships (animal, woman)
- Exteriority in games: Go vs. Chess
  - Go pieces are anonymous elements with situational functions
  - War without battle lines or confrontation
  - Differences in functioning and space occupation (territorializing/deterritorializing)

**The State's Perception of the War Machine:**
- Negative form: stupidity, deformity, madness, illegitimacy, usurpation, sin
- Historians follow this negative tradition, e.g., Genghis Khan misunderstood cities

**Conceptualizing the Exteriority of the War Machine:**
- Difficult but apparent in mythology and history.

---

### A Struggle Between Exteriority and Interiority

**War Machine vs State Apparatus**
- War machine is a pure form of exteriority, while State apparatus is interiority
- War machine tends to be confused with State violence or military institution
- Identifying war machine with state power muddles understanding
- War machine is located between the two poles of political sovereignty and proclaims its irreducibility

**State's Perspective on War Machine**
- States have mistrust towards their military institutions due to inheriting an extrinsic war machine
- Karl von Clausewitz recognizes this dynamic interrelation between State and war machine
- Man of war is trapped between the two poles, condemned and with no future

**Kleist's Perspective on War Machine**
- Celebrates war machine, setting it against State apparatus in a struggle lost from the start
- Affects become uprooted from interiority to exteriority, creating a catatonic rhythm
- War machine ceases to exist when conquered by the State but displays irreducibility through various expressions.

---

### The Role of War and Social Mechanisms

**War Machine vs. State Apparatus**

**Problem I:**
- Is there a way of warding off the formation of a State apparatus (or its equivalents in a group)?

**Proposition II:**
- The exteriority of the war machine is also attested to by ethnology.
- Primitive societies may have chiefs but do not necessarily form a State due to mechanisms for preventing it.
  - Special institutions necessary to make a chief into a man of power
  - Diffuse, collective mechanisms to prevent chief from becoming one
- War in primitive societies maintains segmentarity and prevents the State.
- War is against the State, as it limits exchanges and maintains alliances.

**Collective Mechanisms of Inhibition:**
- Subtle mechanisms functioning as micromechanisms
  - Gangs: collective sharing, dispersal, pairing off members with allies to threaten group disintegration if leader is disagreed with
- Leadership in bands or packs inhibits stable powers in favor of immanent relations.

**Comparison to High Society:**
- Packs/bands operate by diffusion of prestige rather than reference to centers of power (contrast to social groups)
- Eugene Sue's statement: "I side with the pack, not the family"

**War Machine vs. State:**
- The war machine answers to different rules and impedes formation of the State.
  - Fundamental indiscipline of warrior
  - Questioning hierarchy, perpetual blackmail by abandonment or betrayal, volatile sense of honor
- Clastres' argument: primitive counter-State societies vs. monstrous State societies whose formation cannot be explained

**Challenges:**
- Difficulty understanding how the State can be explained without recourse to dialectics or progressive factors.
- The State seems to rise up in a single stroke, with no clear explanation for its emergence.

---

### War Machines and Nomadic Science

**Clastres' Fascination with Voluntary Servitude**
- Clastres was fascinated by the problem of **voluntary servitude**, as explored in La Boetie's work
- He questioned how and why people willingly chose servitude, which did not come from an involuntary or unfortunate war
- Clastres tended to see primitive societies as self-sufficient entities with formal exteriority becoming real independence
- This led him to evolutionist views, positing a **state of nature** and sudden mutation instead of gradual development

**State and Counter-State Societies**
- The State rises up fully formed, while counter-State societies use specific mechanisms to prevent it from arising
- Clastres' interlinkage between these two propositions was flawed
- There is an old scenario: from clans to empires or bands to kingdoms
- These two terms do not represent an evolution, as both organized and less organized societies exist simultaneously

**The Outside of the State**
- The law of the State is not all or nothing but one of interior and exterior
- There are worldwide ecumenical machines with autonomy from States (e.g., commercial organization, industrial complexes)
- Local mechanisms of bands and margins affirm segmentary society against State power
- The modern world showcases these two directions: global machines and neoprimitivism or new tribal societies
- These directions are present in all social fields and periods; they may even merge (e.g., commercial organization as a band of piracy)

**The War Machine vs. State Apparatuses**
- The exteriority of the war machine is nomadic and metamorphic, unlike the identity-based State apparatuses
- Both coexist and compete in a perpetual field of interaction
- Epistemology attests to this external science or treatment of science that uses a vortical model rather than linear solid things.

---

### A Study on Problem-Solving and Transformation

**The Differences Between Royal and Nomad Science**

**Nomad Science**:
- Focuses on problem-solving, rather than deduction from stable essences
- Involves deformations, transmutations, passages to the limit, operations that designate events more than essential truths
- Includes elements like square, cube, and straight line, which are not independent of their associated processes (e.g., quadrature, cubature, rectification)
- Represents a "war machine" that surpasses obstacles, a projection into abstract knowledge
- Developed eccentrically, separate from "royal or imperial sciences"
- Often barred, inhibited, or banned by the demands and conditions of state science

**Examples of Nomad Science**:
- Descriptive and projective geometry
- Differential calculus (originally had parascientific status, labeled as a "Gothic hypothesis")
- Hydraulic model (represents fluid occupying smooth space through turbulent movement)

**State Science**:
- Reduces the range of the problem-element and subordinates it to theorem-element
- Imposes its form of sovereignty on nomad science inventions
- Turns non-metric, dynamic notions into strictly limited formulas with little scientific status
- Represses or bans nomad science that doesn't conform to its rules and order

**Borders Between Nomad and State Science**:
- Encampment (castrametation) art: Submitted to civil and metric rules, localizing nomad science
- Mathematical figures and equations used to organize surfaces and volumes in Gothic architecture

**The Sea as a Smooth Space**:
- Relates to the task of occupying an open space with vortical movement that can rise up at any point
- Rhythm is not the same as measure; there is rhythm without measure, relating to the manner in which a fluid occupies a smooth space

**Examples of Savants Caught Between Nomad and State Science**:
- Democritus, Menaechmus, Archimedes, Vauban, Desargues, Bernoulli, Monge, Carnot, Poncelet, Perronet, etc.

**Conclusion**:
- The tension between the two types of science (nomad and royal) reappears in different moments and on different levels

---

### The Case of Archimedean Geometry and Bridge Building

**Archimedean Geometry: An Alternative Form of Mathematical Understanding**
- Bernard de Clairvaux's approach to Archimedean geometry was considered too difficult and more of a "mathegraphy" than a "matheology" by monk-mason Garin de Troyes.
- Instead of focusing on equations, this form of geometry emphasized the logical movement and trajectory that enabled one to draw and hew volumes in space.

**Desargues' Contributions and Opposition**
- The seventeenth-century mathematician Desargues took Archimedean geometry to a higher level but faced opposition from the Parlement of Paris due to his practices of perspective.
- Royal science only tolerated static perspective, which restricted its heuristic and ambulatory capacities.

**Division of Labor and Collective Bodies**
- In the eighteenth century, there was a division between centralized roadways under government control and the active experimentation in bridge construction.
- Trudaine and Perronet's approaches to bridge building challenged traditional models with their emphasis on lightness, continuity, and dynamic adaptation.

**Collective Bodies: Beyond Organismic Models**
- Collective bodies are not reducible to organisms or the soul of an organization.
- They can constitute themselves as a war machine, following different models and dynamics than the State.
- The lobby is an example of a fluid and ambiguous group in relation to both influencing the State and promoting nomadic ambitions.

**Fringes and Minorities within Collective Bodies**
- Collective bodies have fringes or minorities that reconstitute equivalents of the war machine in specific assemblages like building, judging, making music, or instituting science/technology.
- These fringes may exhibit unforeseen forms and can challenge the State through periods of revolution or experimental surges.

**Protogeometry: Vague Essences Beyond Sensible Things and Ideal Essences**
- Protogeometry addresses vague, nomadic morphological essences that are distinct from sensible things and ideal, royal, or imperial essences.
- This science is not inexact like sensible things nor exact like ideal essences but anexactly rigorous.

---

### A Comparative Analysis by Husserl

**Husserl's View on Nomad Science and Royal Science**

**Characteristics of Nomad Science:**
- Vague essences extract determination beyond thinghood (corporeality)
- Constantly shifting borderline with royal science
- Not a simple technology or practice, but a scientific field
- Opposed to the State's primacy for royal science
- Dividing labor differently than royal science
- Skilled labor opposed to metric plane of architect
- Plane of consistency (composition) vs. organization/formation
- Matter laden with singularities, not prepared or homogenized
- Expression inseparable from pertinent traits

**Characteristics of Royal Science:**
- Hylomorphic model: form organizes matter and matter is prepared for the form
- Divided society into governors and governed, intellectuals and manual laborers
- All matter assigned to content, all form passes into expression
- Represses nomad science due to division of labor opposed norms
- Foundation of hylomorphic schema: invariable form for variables (equations)
- Material-forces rather than matter-form for nomad science
- Continuous variation of variables instead of extracting constants.

---

### Gravity and Celerity in Science

**Opposition between Logos and Nomos:**
- Individuation through events or haecceities vs. object as compound of matter and form (vague essences)
- Opposition between law (logos) and custom (nomos)
- Universal attraction as law of all laws
- Homogeneous space: striated, lamellar, laminar movement of flows

**Gravity and Striated Space:**
- Foundation for metric or arborescent multiplicities
- Laminar, homogeneous, centered space based on force of gravity
- Opposition between smooth and striated spaces

**Smooth Space:**
- Space of contact, small tactile actions
- Nonmetric, acentered, rhizomatic multiplicities
- Irreducible to field of attraction and model of gravitational forces
- Example: system of sounds or colors as opposed to Euclidean space

**Qualitative Opposition:**
- Speed vs. slowness, quick vs. weighty
- Celeritas (celerity) and Gravitas (weight), not quantitative opposition

**Scientific Procedures:**
- Reproduction: deduction, induction, permanent point of view external to subject matter
- Following: itineration, ambulant sciences, different from reproducing ideal.

---

#### "Exploring Ambulant Sciences and the Limits of Royal Knowledge"

**Concepts:**
- Singularities vs Forms
- Deterritorialization vs Reterritorialization
- Ambulant sciences
- Smooth space vs Striated space
- Itinerant sciences
- Nomadic status of primitive metallurgy
- Complexity of ambulant procedures and processes
- Resistances to reterritorialization in royal science
- Problematic mode of knowledge acquisition
- Royal science's theorematic or axiomatic power
- Metric power of royal science
- Interaction between ambulant and royal sciences

**Thesis:**
- Thought is constrained by the State model
- Two heads of thought: mythos (imperium) and logos (republic)

**Arguments:**
1. Ambulant sciences confined to nonautonomous solutions, dependent on collective activities but reliant on royal science for scientific solutions.
2. Royal science defines goals, paths, conduits, channels, organs, an entire organon for thought; creates an image of thought covering all of thought.
3. Singularities vs forms: smooth space versus striated space.
4. Deterritorialization and reterritorialization in science.
5. Complexity of ambulant procedures and processes.
6. Resistances to reterritorialization in royal science.
7. Problematic mode of knowledge acquisition in ambulant sciences vs formal solutions in royal science.
8. Two poles of sovereignty: mythos (imperium) and logos (republic).
9. Interaction between ambulant and royal sciences.

**Implications:**
- Thought is constrained by the State model but can be freed through understanding its limitations and embracing alternative modes of knowledge acquisition.
- The complexity of ambulant procedures and processes reveals resistances to reterritorialization in royal science, opening up new possibilities for scientific exploration.
- By recognizing the difference between smooth space and striated space, one can gain a better understanding of how thought is shaped by various models and approaches.
- Embracing both mythos (imperium) and logos (republic) aspects of thought can lead to a more comprehensive understanding of reality and human experience.

### The State and the Formation of Interiority

**The Relationship Between Thought and the State**

**Interference of Two Heads:**
- Classical image: a republic of free spirits with a Supreme Being as their prince
- Necessary to one another for thought to exist as principle or form of interiority
- Metaphor, not just a metaphor

**Gains for Both Thought and State:**
- Thought gains gravity and center, making everything appear on its own efficacy
- State gains consensus and universality, becoming the sole principle separating rebel from consenting subjects

**Modern Philosophy and the Rational State:**
- Everything revolves around legislator and subject in modern philosophy and rational State
- Distinction between legislator and subject under formal conditions for thought to conceptualize their identity
- Philosophers have blessed established powers by assigning themselves the role of ground

**Images of Thought:**
- Noology: study of images of thought and their historicity
- Counterthoughts, violent acts, discontinuous appearances, awaiting a people to come
- Private thinker is not a good expression as it exaggerates interiority

**Exteriority of Thought:**
- Destroys image and copies, subordinating thought to models of the True, Just, or Right
- Method draws a path from one point to another in the striated space of cogitatio universalis.

---

### Artaud, Kleist, and the War Machine

**The Form of Exteriority in Thought:**
* Smooth space for thought with no image or model
* Operates on central breakdown, living by its own incapacity to take form
* Relays and intermezzos instead of architectonic models or monuments
* Artists and philosophers as evidence against purposiveness of nature
* Two texts: Artaud's letters to Jacques Riviere and Kleist's On the Gradual Formation of Ideas in Speech
* Thought as a proceeding, process, antidialogue between brother and sister
* Operates by relays instead of forming an image or essence-thought
* Appeals to a people rather than taking itself for a government ministry

**The Dangers of Nomad Thought:**
* Potential for race and orientation themes to turn into racism, fascism, sects, folklore
* Distinction between race as an oppressed minority and dominant race
* Race defined by impurity conferred upon it by domination systems
* Only those who acknowledge their inferiority can invoke race
* Orient exists only in constructing smooth space for thought.

#### "Understanding Nomadic Existence and the Nature of Smooth Spaces in 'The War Machine'"

**Nomadic Life vs Sedentary Life**

**Three Aspects of the War Machine**
- Spatiogeographic aspect: territory, customary paths, points
- Arithmetic or algebraic aspect: distribution in open space, lack of borders or enclosure
- Affective aspect: difference between speed and movement, nomad vs migrant/sedentary

**Nomads vs Migrants**
- Nomads cling to smooth space left by receding forest
- They distribute themselves in a smooth space and occupy it
- They do not depart, but respond to challenge of advancing desert or steppe
- Movements are extensive (movement) vs intensive (speed)
- Absolute character: nomads have speed, vortex-like swirling movement

**Deterritorialization and Reterritorialization**
- Nomads deterritorialize land itself, making it a smooth space
- No reterritorialization afterward as with migrants or sedentaries
- Deterritorialization constitutes nomad's relation to the earth

**Nomad Space vs Sedentary Space**
- Sedentary space is striated by walls, enclosures, roads between enclosures
- Nomad space is smooth, marked only by traits that are effaced and displaced with trajectory
- Nomads distribute themselves in a smooth space, inhabit it, hold territory principle.

---

### A Study on the Interplay between State Forms and War Machines

**Nomads vs. Religion:**
- **Nomads**: local absolute appears as horizon, not delimited by place
- **Religion**: converts absolute to universal or spiritual State, favors sedentarization and establishment
- **Monotheistic religions**: encounter problems with nomadic components due to their need for orientation and imperial de jure State
- **War machine vs. religion:** holy war as motor of the machine, liberates nomadism or absolute deterritorialization
- **Crusades**: Christian adventure that mobilized nomadism and turned against the State-form

**Smooth Space:**
- Control by two striated spaces: forest and agriculture
- Nomads turn against forest dwellers, then descend upon farmers
- Implies certain components: forest clearing, agriculture grid laying, animal raising subordinated to agricultural work, commerce based on town-country communications
- Differences between Orient and West in State composition: deforestation vs. clearing for planting, cultivation type, animal raising, low communication content of town-country relation

---

### Striated vs. Smooth Spaces and the War Machine

**States:**
- Made up of people, wood, fields, gardens, animals, commodities
- Unity in composition but varying development and organization
- Eastern States: disconnected components requiring an immutable Form
- Western States: interconnected components enabling transformations through revolution
- State's role to striate space or control smooth spaces as means of communication
- Need for fixed paths and regulation of circulation
- Response against threats is to striate space, but can result in new nomadic potentials
- Hegemony of the West: annexing the Atlantic, reconstituting smooth space with absolute movement
- Smooth space does not have irresistible revolutionary calling, meaning changes depending on interactions and conditions.

**War Machine:**
- Nomads form war machine by inventing absolute speed
- State attempts to striate sea as a dependency of the land
- Multiplication of relative movements in striated space can reconstitute smooth space or absolute movement
- War machine's organization exceeds state apparatuses and passes into energy, military-industrial, multinational complexes.

**Numbers:**
- Armies retain decimal groupings: units, companies, divisions
- Not about quantity but organization or composition of soldiers
- Numbers vary in function and combination; enter into different strategies.

#### "The Nomadic Origin and Autonomous Role of Numerical Organization in Human Society"

**Numerical Organization in State Societies**

**Background:**
- Hyksos conquering nomads brought numerical organization to Egypt
- Moses applied it during exodus, with advice from Jethro the Kenite
- Numerical principle became dominant in State societies

**Comparison with Lineal and Territorial Organization:**
- Lineal organization: primitive societies, meld and divide according to lineages
- Territorial organization: State societies, envelops space or deterritorialized relation between humans and earth

**Role of Arithmetic in States:**
- Early use in census, taxation, election
- Increased importance with modern forms of the state
- Control over primary matters, secondary matter, human population through numbering

**Numbering Number (Autonomous Arithmetic Organization):**
- Not a result of abstraction or large quantities
- Conditions of possibility: nomadism; conditions of effectuation: war machine
- Independent from space, occupies smooth space as subject
- Directional number, not dimensional or metric one

**Comparison with Geometry:**
- State armies: importance in striated space for fortification and cadence
- Nomad organization: rhythmic, not harmonic; only in state armies for reasons of discipline and show.

**Characteristics of Nomadic Numerical Unit:**
- Ambulant fire takes precedence over the yurt or tent
- Directional number, not dimensional or metric one
- Cipher (Chiffre) constitutes esprit de corps and invents strategy, espionage, war ruses.

---

### Arithmetic Composition and Strategy in Nomadic Organizations

**Characteristics of the Numbering Number:**

**Nomadic Organization and War Machine**:
- Necessary consequence of nomadic organization
- Criticized as military or concentration camp society
- Distinct from lineal codes and State overcoding

**Articulated Complexity**:
- Always a complex, articulated number
- Fine articulation producing immensity by distribution of heterogeneity in free space
- Includes men, weapons, animals, and vehicles
- Unit is an assemblage unit (e.g., man-horse-bow)

**Arithmetic Replication or Doubling**:
- Lineages are numerically organized with a superimposed numerical composition
- Men are extracted to form a special numerical body for the number of the body

**Double Deterritorialization**:
- Necessary operation for the autonomy of the number
- First series: replacement of lineal organization by numerical composition
- Second series: conjuring away territorial organization of the State

**Power in War Machine**:
- No longer based on segments and centers but on relations internal to the Number
- Tensions or power struggles between different groups (e.g., Moses' tribes vs. Levites, Genghis Khan's noyans vs. antrustions)

**Operations of Numerical Composition**:
- Arithmetization of starting aggregates or sets (lineages)
- Union of extracted subsets (constitution of groups)
- Formation by substitution of another set in correspondence with the united set (special body)

**Logistics and External Relations**:
- Logistics is the art of external relations, expressing proportion of combatants among members of a lineage or tribe
- Role of reserves, stocks, and upkeep of people, things, and animals

---

### Weapons, Power, and Transformation

**Nomadic War Machine and Special Bodies**

**Formation of a Distinct Special Body**:
- Can be constructed in several ways:
  - From a privileged lineage or tribe, with dominance taking on new meaning (e.g., Moses and the Levites)
  - From representatives of each lineage, serving as hostages (firstborn; Asian case or Genghis)
  - From a totally different element, exterior to the base society (slaves, foreigners, people of another religion)
- Institution as an element determinant of power in the war machine

**Nomads and War Machine**:
- Ward off:
  - Return of lineal aristocracy
  - Formation of imperial functionaries
- Power of slaves, foreigners, or captives in a nomadic origin war machine is different from that of lineal aristocracies and State functionaries/bureaucrats
- Special body becomes a soldier and believer while remaining deterritorialized
- Specific schools or institutions needed for this purpose

**Critique of Nomads**:
- Historians dismiss nomads as incapable of innovation (technology, agriculture, cities/States)
- Difficult to see how nomads could have triumphed in war without strong metallurgical capabilities

**Military Democracy and Feudalism vs. Nomadic Organization**:
- Presuppose a territorial principle (appropriation of war machine or property relations among owners)
- Subordination of number to immobile fiscal organization for taxation purposes
- Nomads invent territoriality and movable fiscal organization, subordinating land to numbers

**Weapons vs. Tools**:
- Weapons have a privileged relation with projection (ballistic)
- Tools are more introceptive and introjective, preparing matter for equilibrium or interiority
- Missile weapons are only one kind of weapon, but handheld weapons require projective usage

---

### Tools, Weapons, and the Economy of Violence

**War Machine vs. Weapon-Speed Complementarity**
* War machine exists with centrifugal (tool) and centripetal (weapon) actions
* Tools have a different relation to movement compared to weapons
* Weapons invent speed or the discovery of it, leading to dromocracy (nomos)
* War not derived from hunting but an economy of violence
* Horseback riding discovered projecting and projectile system for war machine
* Release of Speed vector in war machine, not just associated with hunted animal's speed.

**Characteristics of the War Machine**
* Implies release of a Speed vector that becomes independent variable
* Abstract concept of motor abstracted from prey, applied to soldier
* Two objections: weight vs. immobility and similarity between tool and weapon
	+ Equilibrium of forces in striated space can relate to resistance or conditions under which State apparatuses appropriate the war machine
	+ Speed as a property of projectile, bullet or artillery shell may lead to immobility for soldier
* Opposition between rest and tension, defense and attack
* Qualitative models: work vs. free action.

**Work Model vs. Free Action Model**
* Work model: motor cause meets resistances, consumed in effect, relative speed
* Free action model: motor cause no resistance, operates on mobile body itself, absolute speed
* Weapons and tool handling linked to free-action model; tools define work but presuppose it.

**Technical Element vs. Social or Collective Machine**
* Primary concept is the machine that determines a technical element's usage, extension, comprehension etc.
* Phylum selects, qualifies and invents technical elements through assemblages.

### A Perspective on Force, Assemblages, and Desire

**The Difference Between Weapons and Tools**

**Weapons vs. Tools**:
- Not distinguished by external characteristics
- Have no distinctive intrinsic characteristics
- Characteristics are related to the respective assemblages they are associated with

**Effectuation of Models**:
- Free-action model: weapon's association with speed vector, not tied to conditions of gravity
- Work model: tool's association with genesis, displacement, and expenditure of force

**Primeracy of Collective Assemblage**:
- Weapons and tools are consequences of the collective assemblage they are bound up with
- Example: Hoplite weapons existed only by virtue of the phalanx as a mutation of the war machine

**Tool vs. Work Regime**:
- Tool regime: tied to gravity, displacement, weight, and height system
- Weapon regime: concerned with the exercise or manifestation of force in space and time

**Desire and Passion in Assemblages**:
- Desire has no natural or spontaneous determination
- Desire is a part of assemblies that bring certain passions into play
- Work regime is inseparable from an organization, development of Form, and formation of the subject (passional regime of feeling)
- War machine regime is about affects, related to moving body and speeds.

---

### Nomadic vs. State Assemblages

**The Difference Between Tools and Weapons**

**Tools vs. Signs:**
- Tools belong to the State apparatus, defined by a work model
- Signs cease to be inscribed on the body and are written upon immobile matter
- For work to occur, there must be a capture of activity by the State apparatus and semiotization by writing
- Affinity between assemblages signs-tools and signs of writing-organization of work

**Weapons vs. Jewelry:**
- Weapon in an essential relation with jewelry
- Jewelry: easy to transport, attached to movable objects
- Relation between them is motif-support, where earth is no longer more than ground
- Lend colors the speed of light, turning gold to red and silver to white
- Attached to horse's harness, sword sheath, warrior's garments, even one-time use objects like arrowheads
- Free action related to pure mobility, not work with conditions of gravity, resistance, and expenditure
- Goldsmithing and jewelry making are the nomadic war machine's contribution

**Runic Writing:**
- Originated on jewelry, fibulas, elements of metalworking, small movable objects
- Weak communication value, very restricted public function in early period
- Secret character may be interpreted as magical writing but is an affective semiotic
- Comprises signatures and short war or love messages, ornamental text rather than scriptural
- Gained utility during second period with monumental inscriptions and Danish reform

**Differential Traits:**
- Direction (projection-introception), vector (speed-gravity), model (free action-work), expression (jewelry-signs), passional or desiring tonality (affect-feeling)

**The Man of War and the Worker:**
- The man of war has been transformed into a military man
- Worker has undergone many misadventures
- Schizophrenic taste for tool moves it away from work towards free action, weapon turns into means for peace.

---

### Metallurgy and Technological Lineages

**Nomads and Weapons**

**Nomad Inventions**:
- Nomads invented the "man-animal-weapon" assemblage (e.g., man-horse-bow)
- This led to innovations in offensive/defensive weapons, composition, strategy, and technological elements (e.g., saddle, stirrup, horseshoe)
- Nomads marked the ages of metal with their weapon innovations (e.g., socketed bronze battle-ax, iron sword)
- Nomads lost role as innovators with advent of firearms, but still contributed to development of light artillery in mobile formations

**Challenges in Identifying Nomad Contributions**:
- Difficulty distinguishing between nomad inventions and received technologies from empires
- Prejudices against nomads can influence historical interpretations
- Lack of a sophisticated concept of technological lineages

**The Case of Crucible Steel Saber**:
- Saber was first introduced by Scythians, but originated in Chinese empire's metallurgical innovations
- Attempts to explain saber's spread focused on deserters revealing secrets, rather than metallurgists communicating knowledge
- Metallurgy involves complex variations and transformations that are difficult to categorize

**Conclusion**:
- Nomads played a significant role in weapon innovations throughout history
- Identifying their contributions is challenging due to historical prejudices and lack of sophisticated concepts in technological studies.

#### "Exploring the Singularities and Traits of Expression in Machinic Phyla and Technological Assemblages"

**Machinic Phylum and Assemblages**

**Machinic Phylum**:
- Singularities and operations converge upon one or several assignable traits of expression
- Prolongable by certain operations
- Ideally continuous: the flow of matter-movement, the flow of matter in continuous variation, conveying singularities and traits of expression
- Artificial as well as natural

**Assemblages**:
- Constellation of singularities and traits deducted from the flow
- Selected, organized, stratified to converge (consistency) artificially and naturally
- Can group into vast constellations constituting cultures or ages
- Differentiate phyla or flow, introducing selective discontinuities in ideal continuity of matter-movement
- Selective action on the phylum, evolutionary reaction of the phylum

**Technological Vitalism**:
- Leroi-Gourhan's idea: Universal Tendency, laden with all singularities and traits of expression, traverses technical and interior milieus
- Assemblages invent various phyla; matter-movement creates technical assemblages

**Vague Essences**:
- Distinct from formed things and formal essences
- Constitute fuzzy aggregates
- Characterized by passages to the limit, processes of deformation or transformation, expressive or intensive qualities
- Ambulant coupling: events-affects

---

### Following the Flow of Metallurgical Matter

**Hylomorphic Model Critique:**
* Hylomorphic model misunderstands form and matter as separate terms
* Overlooks continuous variation between them
* Translation into a model distorts intuition lost
* Materiality is matter in movement, flux, variation (machinic phylum)
* Following the flow of matter: itinerance, artisan, prospector
* Nomads determined by smooth space occupation
* Metallurgy and metallicity primary relation to itinerance.

**Matter as Flow vs Circuit:**
* Itinerant vs transhumant or migrant
* Nomads primarily defined by smooth spaces
* Differences in concepts, implications, order of production

**Metallurgy and Metallicity:**
* Operations always astride thresholds
* Energetic materiality overspills prepared matter
* Qualitative deformation or transformation overspills form
* Metal's unique form: not stock or commodity.

---

### A Transformative Relationship with Matter

**Metallurgy and Reduction Process**
- Metallurgical idea of reducer: double liberation of materiality in relation to prepared matter, transformation in relation to form to be incarnated
- Succession of forms replaced by continuous development, variable matters transformed into continuous variation
- Essential relation between metallurgy and music through sounds of forge and tendency for continuous development of form and variation of matter
- Consciousness or thought of matter flow: metal coextensive to whole matter, all matter connected to metallurgy

**Metal as Body Without Organs**
- Metal neither a thing nor organism but body without organs
- Mineral productivity followed by artisans-metallurgists as producers of objects par excellence
- Itinerant metallurgists follow the matter flow, have relations with farmers, celestial functionaries, forest dwellers, and nomads

**Control Over Mines: Political Complexities**
- Metallurgy involves complex politics: strong imperial bureaucracy and elaborate long-distance commercial circuits; shifting politics among States and different peoples regarding control of mines
- Clandestine exploitation and miner's alliances with nomadic incursions or peasant revolts
- Mythology and ethnology do not have the right method to understand the situation, focus on reactions of others instead of smiths themselves

**Smiths as Other: Different Affective Relations with Nomads and Sedentaries**
- No nomadic or sedentary smiths; ambulant, itinerant by nature
- Live in a space between striated and smooth spaces, inhabit tent or house like cave dwellers
- Important text on itinerant peoples of India and their creation of nonorganic life forms.

---

### Itinerant Smiths and the Communication of Holey Space with Smooth and Striated Spaces

**Behind the Rock:**
- The emptied rock left behind was hollowed out in every direction, with sculptured, chiseled walls and natural or artificial pillars turned into a deep lacework of ten thousand figures.
- This space represents both strength and nothingness, where man extracts affirmation from formlessness according to its dictates.

**Metallurgical India:**
- The metallurgist transpierces mountains instead of scaling them, excavates the land instead of striating it, and bores holes in space instead of keeping it smooth.
- The holey space represents the subsoil passing through both striated land and nomadic ground.

**Cainite Metallurgists:**
- Metallurgists are not nomadic among nomads or sedentary among sedentaries, but communicate with both groups due to their internal itinerancy.
- They exist as a hybrid, an alloy, and a twin formation.
- Endogamy among the pure is because of their simplified progeny, while metallurgists reconstitute a twin progeny.

**Metallurgical Segments:**
- Metallurgists belong to an empire or are mobile and free in the Aegean world.
- The two segments cannot be separated; they are connected through the metallurgist-prospector, merchant, and metalworking.
- Machinic phylum (matter flow) passes through all assemblages but not symmetrically between nomad space and sedentary space.

**War Machine:**
- Nomad war machine is a form of expression; itinerant metallurgy is its correlative content.
- War does not necessarily have the battle as its object, nor does the war machine necessarily have war as its object.
- The ambiguity of these questions depends on the term "object" and their dependency on the third question: how the State apparatus relates to the war machine.

---

### Nomadic Origins and State Domination

**The War Machine: The Relationship between War and the State**

**War Machine**:
- Invention of nomads to destroy state-form and city-form
- War is secondary or synthetic objective, determined to destroy States

**Appropriation by the State**:
- When the State appropriates war machine:
  - Changes in nature and function
  - Directed against nomads and state destroyers
  - Subordinated to state aims
- Problems of appropriation:
  1. Hesitation of nomads, enabling state control
  2. Danger for the State when it acquires war machine
     - Tamerlane example: constructing a powerful war machine against nomads, but also needing heavy state apparatus to maintain it
- Forms of appropriation:
  - Mercenary or territorial?
    * Professional army or conscripted?
    * Special body or national recruiting?
    * Mixes between these forms
- Means of appropriation:
  - Territorialization of war machine (colonial/domestic land grants)
  - Fiscal regimes and taxes on beneficiary warriors and society for army maintenance.

---

### From Nomadic War Machine to Total War and Beyond

**Clausewitz's Formula: War and Politics**

**War as Idea vs. Real Wars:**
- War machine as unconditioned war (nomadic) vs. war submitted to state aims
- Nomad war machine is the content adequate to the Idea, not a real war among others

**Importance of Distinction:**
- Clausewitz's formula: war is the continuation of politics by other means
- Pure concept of war as absolute vs. real wars under State aims

**Relationship between Absolute War and Real Wars:**
- Nomad war machine doesn't have war as its object, but a synthetic relation with it
- States appropriate and condition realization in experience

**State Evolution:**
- Figures of encastment to forms of appropriation proper
- Limited war to total war (capitalistic investment)
- Transformation of aim and object relation

**Total War:**
- Annihilation of enemy army or State, entire population and economy involved
- Capitalistic tendencies: constant and variable capital investments

**Clausewitz's Vacillation:**
- Political aim remains essential but unlimited object in total war
- Appropriation changes direction, States become objects or means adapted to the war machine

**Present Situation:**
- Growing strength of state or world war machine
- Increasingly wider political functions and maintaining local wars as parts of itself
- Unexpected possibilities for counterattacks and initiatives from various sources.

---

### Destruction vs. Creation

**The War Machine**

**Poles of the War Machine**:
- At one pole, war is its object and forms a line of destruction prolongable to the limits of the universe
- At another pole, war represents only the conditions or dominant order under which the States appropriate the machine

**Nomads and the Invention of the War Machine**:
- The nomads are not the inventors of the war machine
- An ideological, scientific, or artistic movement can be a potential war machine if it draws a creative line of flight, smooth space, and movement of people
- The characteristics define the nomad and the essence of the war machine

**Contrasting Poles**:
- Guerrilla, minority, revolutionary, and popular warfare are in conformity with the essence as they take war as a supplementary object to create new social relations
- The difference between the two poles is great, even from the perspective of death: one creates, the other destroys
- There is communication between the lines or planes, but they are incommensurable in terms of the quantities they confront each other with

**Apparatuses and War Machines**:
- War machines take shape against the apparatuses that appropriate the machine and make war their affair and object
- They bring connections to bear against the great conjunction of the apparatuses of capture or domination

## 13. 7000 B.C.: Apparatus of Capture

**Proposition X: The State and its Poles**
- Political sovereignty has two poles: the fearsome magician-emperor and the jurist-priest-king
- Magic emperor operates by capture, bonds, knots, and nets; jurist-king proceeds by treaties, pacts, contracts
- War function is exterior to political sovereignty

**State Apparatus Characteristics**
- Curious rhythm: Binder-Gods (magic emperors) vs. One-Armed men (jurist-kings)
- Differential trait of political sovereignty: signs-tools
- Magic emperor uses weapons like capture, suspension of combat; jurist-king organizes war, imposes laws
- War machine is exterior to both State poles but necessary for transition between them

**Mutilation and the State Apparatus**
- Predisabled people (congenitally infirm, one-eyed and one-armed) needed by State apparatus
- Myth of zombies: mutilated people exist before being acknowledged
- Triumph of morality of scalpel in creating predisabled people

**Historical Analogies**
- Odin vs. Tyr: Magic sovereign (Odin) and warrior class (Tyr)
- Horatius Codes vs. Mucius Scaevola: One-Eyed man (Horatius) and political tack (Mucius)
- Marcel Detienne's analysis of ancient Greece: magic sovereign, warrior class, hoplite reform

**Implications**
- War machine intervenes between State poles, assuring passage from one to the other
- No causal meaning can be assigned; war machine explains nothing but is necessary for evolution of State.

---

### Imperial Regime and Primitive Societies

**Proposition XI: Imperial or Despotic State**
- Corresponds to Marx's Asiatic formation
- Discovered in Neolithic times, even further back
- State apparatus erected upon primitive agricultural communities
- Overcodes them, submits them to the power of a despotic emperor
  - Single public owner of land and resources
  - Organizes large-scale works (surplus labor)
  - Source of public functions and bureaucracy
- Regime of overcoding or Signifier: machinic enslavement, first megamachine

**Characteristics of Imperial State:**
- Everything is public: communal ownership, no alienable commodities
- Money exists but not used for buying-selling
- Functionaries have land with their position (hereditary)
- Presupposes a certain level of development in productive forces
  - Potential surplus necessary to constitute State stock
  - Support for specialized handicrafts class (metallurgy)
  - Progressive giving rise to public functions

**Imperial State vs. Neolithic States:**
- Stock presupposes a potential surplus, not the other way around
- State creates agriculture, animal raising, metallurgy in its own milieu first
- Then imposes them upon surrounding world: town creates country
- Challenges evolutionism by establishing a clean break with no progressive development
  - Not the result of a development of forces of production (even Neolithic revolution)

**Clastres' Theses:**
1. Primitive societies are not lacking a State but organizing mechanisms against it
2. When State arises, it is in the form of an irreducible break, not the result of progressive development

**Ethnology vs. Archaeology:**
- Ethnologists compare their territories abstractly or structurally
- Refuse to set ethnographical and archaeological territories against each other
  - Coexistence and superposition of maps ignored

**Catal Hiiyuk:**
- Stock performs hybridizations and selections, creating agriculture and animal raising
- State establishes itself in milieu of hunter-gatherers with no prior agriculture or metallurgy
- Creates agriculture, animal raising, and metallurgy on its own soil first, then imposes them upon surrounding world.

---

### The Coexistence and Interaction of Primitive Societies, States, and Nomadic War Machines

**Relation Between Ethnology and History**
- Idealist confrontation reduced to society without or against history
- Writing and speech presuppose the State
- Primitive communities coexist with States in complex network
- Speech communities, languages determine relations between non-understanding groups
- Language made for translation, not communication

**Evolutionism vs. Ethnological Dreams**
- Economic, ecological evolutionism impossible
- Nomads, semiurban sedentaries, sedentaries all exist simultaneously
- War machine invented by nomads to oppose towns and States

**Nomad and Primitive Peoples**
- Primitive peoples had mechanisms to prevent State formation
- Nomads became autonomous with their specific war machine
- Cannot infer zigzag evolution from primitive to States or vice versa
- Coexistence of becomings translated into succession by history

**Hunter-Gatherers as Basis for State Formation?**
- Inadequate conception of causality
- Human sciences lag behind complexity of causal relations in physics and biology
- Reverse causalities shatter evolutionism

**Primitive Societies before and after the State**
- Two inverse movements: primitive peoples before, State after
- Coexistence of two directions of time: contemporaneousness or coexistence
- Collective mechanisms ward off and anticipate central power's appearance
- Threshold of consistency not evolutionary but coexisting with anticipated change.

---

### Towns, Power, and Deterritorialization in History

**The Mediterranean World's Urban Fabric vs. Imperial Organisms of the Orient**

**Two Thresholds of Consistency**:
- Town: Correlate of roads, exists as a function of circulation and circuits
- Defined by entries/exits, imposes frequency, causes phylum to pass through specific places
- Represents a threshold of deterritorialization
- Commercial character is spiritual, like network of monasteries or temple-cities
- Causes complete but local integration along horizontal lines

**State vs. Town**:
- State: Phenomenon of intraconistency, makes points resonate together, operates by stratification
- Forms vertical, hierarchized aggregate that spans horizontal lines
- States have multiple forms, each separated from the others

**Primitive Societies and Thresholds**:
- Prevent potential central points from crystallizing
- Circles not concentric, two segments require a third to communicate

**Urban vs. State Revolution**:
- Both thresholds imply deterritorialization in relation to primitive codes
- Reciprocal presupposition: City and State each necessitate the other
- Towns may break free when State's overcoding causes decoded flows
- Corporative and commercial towns can create autonomy from State, but do not fully anticipate or replace capitalism

**Capitalism and the State**:
- Capitol was not created by towns, despite urban recoding tendency
- Banks and commercial towns inhibit general conjunction of decoded flows
- States disciplined towns through relentless institutional control

---

### A Machinic Perspective

**Social Formations and Machinic Processes**
- Social formations defined by machinic processes, not modes of production
- Primitive societies: mechanisms of prevention-anticipation
- State societies: apparatuses of capture
- Urban societies: instruments of polarization
- Nomadic societies: war machines
- International, ecumenical organizations: encompassment of heterogeneous social formations

**Coexistence and Interaction between Formations**
- Primitive societies cannot prevent empire formation without anticipating it
- States cannot capture unless what is captured coexists, resists, or escapes in new forms
- Numerical composition of war machine superposed on primitive lineal organization
- Extrinsic coexistence: interaction between different social formations
- Diffusion occurs through communication of potentials of very different orders
- International ecumenical organizations not reducible to commercial or economic relations

**Ecumenical Organizations and Worldwide Axiomatic**
- Capitalism as axiomatic, production for the market
- All States and social formations tend toward isomorphism as models of realization
- Isomorphy allows heterogeneity among States but requires peripheral polymorphy
- Intrinsic coexistence: machinic processes can function at different powers

**Apparatuses of Capture vs. War Machines and Anticipation-Prevention Mechanisms**
- State apparatus of capture has power of appropriation, including war machines, instruments of polarization, and prevention mechanisms
- Anticipation-prevention mechanisms have high power of transference and form new resistance points
- War machines have power of metamorphosis, allowing capture but also resistance in new forms.

---

### A Marginalist Perspective

**Marginalism and Collective Evaluation:**
- Concept of last or marginal object determines value of entire series
- Last object marks necessary rebeginning (limit) or inevitable change (threshold)
- Economic given: every enterprise includes evaluation of limit
- Marginalism applies to last exchangeable objects and producers
- Example: alcoholic's last glass, having the last word in a quarrel
- Evaluation of limit present from start for both parties
- Anticipatory evaluation considers ritual character and utilitarian aspects
- Exchanges result from two monologues (palabre)
- No exchange value or use value, but evaluation of last receivable object on both sides.

**Marginal Utility:**
- Relative to assemblages of two groups rather than abstract stock
- Desirability as an assemblage component: every group desires the last receivable object beyond which it would be obliged to change assemblage.

**Primitive Societies:**
- Anticipation-prevention mechanisms constituted by evaluation of last as limit
- Violence can also be submitted to marginal ritual treatment, evaluating the last violence in a series.

---

### Understanding Rent, Profit, and Taxation

**Conditions for Stockpiling:**
- Interest in its own right and desirability (otherwise, objects would be destroyed)
- Coexistence of simultaneously exploited territories or succession on the same territory
- Territories form a "Land" assemblage that includes stockpiling

**Stock vs Exchange Limit:**
- In itinerant assemblages: operation period defined by territory, law is temporal succession
- In stock assemblages: law is spatial coexistence and concerns simultaneous exploitation of different or successive territories
- Stock allows yields to be compared (same planting on different soils or various successive plantings on same soil)

**Ground Rent:**
- Homogenizes conditions of productivity through linking excess of highest over lowest to landowner
- Taps surplus profit accruing to best lands
- Implies deterritorialization of the earth, forming basis for striation and comparison

**Stock's Correlates:**
- Land: comparison and appropriation of different or successive territories
- Work: comparison and monopolistic appropriation of labor (surplus labor)

**Entrepreneurial Profit:**
- Depends on surplus labor and surplus value
- Similar to rent and profit as apparatuses of capture

**Taxation:**
- Money derives from taxation, not exchange or commerce
- Introduces possibility of equivalence money = goods or services.

---

### A Semiological Analysis of Money, Rent, and Labor in Taxation and Exchange

**The Apparatus of Capture**

**Metal Money Distribution in Corinth**:
- Metal money was first distributed to the poor (in their capacity as producers)
- The poor used it to buy land rights, which passed into the hands of the rich, on the condition that it not stop there
- This created an equivalence between money and goods/services for both rich and poor through taxation

**Money Distribution and Equivalence**:
- Money is always distributed by an apparatus of power under conditions of conservation, circulation, and turnover
- This allows the establishment of an equivalence between goods/services and money
- Taxation creates money in motion, circulation, and correspondence with services and goods
- The State uses taxation to monetize the economy and appropriate trade

**Indirect Taxation**:
- Indirect tax is not just an additional cost, but indexes a deeper movement of monetary equalization and capture
- Taxation constitutes the first layer of objective pricing in the market

**The Three Aspects of the Stock: Land, Work, Money**:
1. The stock (land, seeds, tools) comes from another assemblage, not directly from territory, activities, or exchanges
2. The megamachine/apparatus of capture functions in three modes: rent, profit, taxation
3. Comparison and monopolistic appropriation are the key operations of capture

**The Apparatus of Capture and Expression**:
- The State constitutes a general semiology that overcodes primitive semiotic systems
- It subjugates matter to an equalized, homogenized content while expression becomes a form of resonance or appropriation

---

#### "Understanding the Mechanism of Value and Capture in Economic Systems"

**Abstract Machine of Capture**

**Purchasing Power Derives from Wages:**
- Money acquires purchasing power through distribution of wages (set B)
- Sets A and C: real goods, distributed set
- Disjunction between comparative set B' and distributed set B

**Capture Mechanism**:
- Difference or excess constituting profit, surplus labor, or the surplus product
- Nominal wages include everything but only a portion is retained by producers
- Real wages are smaller than nominal wages
- Capture effects an inversion of wave or divisible flow
- Objective of monopolistic appropriation: capitalist mode of production

**Apparatus of Capture and State:**
- Occupied point of comparison and appropriation (State)
- Abstract machine marks real existence of a point of inversion
- Distinction between regimes of violence: struggle, war, crime, policing.

**Capture Precedes Capitalist Mode of Production:**
- Primitive accumulation precedes agricultural mode of production
- Violence creates or contributes to the creation of that which it is directed against.

---

### Overcoding, Decoding, and the Emergence of Private Property

**The State and Its Forms**

**Definition of State:**
- Monopoly of violence but defined as a state of law (Rechts-staat)
- Structural violence that creates what it is used against
- Overcoding: a form of violence that preexists its own use
- Primal and natural phenomenon, responsibility lies with the State

**Evolution of Archaic Imperial State:**
1. **Apparatus of Capture:**
   - Overcodes primitive codes
   - Creates new flows that escape (money, labor, property)
2. **Machine of Enslavement:**
   - Freed slaves play an important role in this process
3. **Decoded Flows and Evolution:**
   - Decoded flows are a correlate of overcoding apparatus
   - Geographical implications: confrontation between East & West
4. **Aegean Peoples vs Oriental Overcoding:**
   - Aegean peoples took advantage of oriental agricultural stock without having to constitute one for themselves
5. **Mycenae and Minos:**
   - More a caricature of an empire compared to Chinese emperor or Egyptian pharaoh
6. **Plundering vs Regular Procurement:**
   - Aegean peoples plundered oriental agricultural stock when they could, otherwise procured it in exchange for raw materials (wood & metals) from Central and Western Europe.
7. **Reproduction of Stocks:**
   - Orient constantly had to reproduce its stocks but formally made a move once and for all, allowing the West to benefit without having to reproduce it.

### From Imperial Signifier to Personal Subjectification

**Metallurgical Artisans and Merchants in Europe vs. Orient:**
- In the West, metallurgists and merchants had a freer status and more diversified market due to lack of dependence on local state surplus
- Many from the Orient moved to Aegean world for more stable conditions
- Flows were decoded in Europe while overcoded in the Orient

**New Public Sphere:**
- State apparatus focused on personal relations and private property instead of objective nature of property
- Bond became personal, with contracts and conventions replacing community or public function relations
- Even slavery changed to private property ownership of individual workers

**Law Mutation:**
- Subjective, conjunctive, topical law replaced overcoding imperial signifier regime
- Second pole presented diverse forms but marked qualified and topical conjunctions

**Institutions:**
- Consilium and fiscus in Roman Empire allowed for political power of freed slaves
- Autonomous cities and feudal systems also developed this new public sphere

**Personal Relations vs. Individuals:**
- Consistency of relations important, not capriciousness or variability of individuals
- Delirium of subjects and qualified acts created rights and obligations

**Capitalism Emergence:**
- Decoded flows continued to flow but were inhibited by topical conjunctions in previous apparatuses
- Abstract conjunction of decoded flows formed capitalism when unqualified wealth met unqualified labor
- Private property became a subjectivity, independent of concrete form it cloaked at each moment.

### The Transformation of Law and State in the Global Economy

**Capitalism and the State: A Complex Relationship**

**The Evolution of Law in Capitalism**
- The law has evolved from overcoding customs (archaic empire) to a set of topics (evolved States, autonomous cities, feudal systems) to an axiomatic (civil code) when flows reach the capitalist threshold.
- When labor becomes naked and independent capital is decoded, there is no longer a need for distinct juridical or political domination to ensure appropriation.

**The Global Reach of Capitalism**
- Capitalism has mobilized a force of deterritorialization that surpasses the deterritorialization proper to the State.
- The economy constitutes a worldwide axiomatic, a universal cosmopolitan energy eluding control by the States and forming a de facto supranational power.

**Capitalism vs. Territoriality**
- Capitalism is not territorial in its beginnings; its power of deterritorialization consists in taking as its object materialized labor or commodities, rather than land or means of production.
- Private property is no longer ownership of the land but convertible abstract rights.

**The Role of States in Capitalism**
- States are not canceled out by capitalism, but change form and take on a new meaning: models of realization for a worldwide axiomatic that exceeds them.
- The State provides compensatory reterritorializations to moderate the superior deterritorialization of capital.

**The Nature of Modern States**
1. Are all modern States isomorphic to the capitalist axiomatic, with differences depending only on concrete variables?
2. Does the world capitalist axiomatic tolerate real polymorphy or heteromorphy of models? Can noncapitalist sectors be integrated into it?
3. Can bureaucratic socialist States develop different modes of production that conjugate with capitalism to form a set whose power exceeds the axiomatic itself? What conflicts and slim chances does this conjunction spawn?

---

### Machinic Enslavement vs. Social Subjection

**A Typology of Modern States**
- Modern states are coupled with a metaeconomics
- Not all states are interchangeable, but treating them as such would be inaccurate
- Privileging a certain form of state or equating bureaucratic socialist states with totalitarian capitalist states would also be inaccurate
- The term "nation-state" refers to the State as a model of realization
- Birth of nations involves many artifices: struggle against imperial, feudal, and autonomous city systems; crushing minorities within
- **Constituents of a Nation**: Land and People (not necessarily innate or pregiven)
- Problem of creating a nation: land without people or people without land
- Methods to create a nation: coldest and bloodiest means vs. romantic upsurges
- Axiomatic is complex, not without passions

**State and Nation Formation**
- **Natal/Land**: Deterritorialization of territories (community land, imperial provinces, seigneurial domains)
- **Popular/People**: Decoding of the population
- Nation constituted on basis of these flows; inseparable from modern state that gives consistency to corresponding land and people
- Naked labor makes people; flow of capital makes land and industrial base
- Nation: collective subjectification, process of subjection (modern state)

**Enslavement vs. Subjectivity**
- **Machinic Enslavement**: Human beings are constituent pieces of a machine under control of higher unity
- **Social Subjection**: Higher unity constitutes human being as a subject linked to an exterior object, not enslaved by the machine but a worker or user
- Modern state substituted powerful social subjection for machinic enslavement

**Axiomatic and Nation-State**
- Axiomatic of decoded flows, constitutes capital as point of subjectification that forms all human beings as subjects
- Capitalists are subjects of enunciation; proletarians are subjects of statement, subjected to technical machines
- Wage regime can take subjection to unprecedented point and exhibit singular cruelty

**Power and Control: Subjection and Enslavement**
- Modern power not reducible to repression or ideology
- Involves processes of normalization, modulation, modeling, and information that bear on language, perception, desire, movement etc.
- Aggregate includes both subjection and enslavement taken to extremes; reinforce and nourish each other

#### "Understanding the Interplay of Subjection and Enslavement in States and Society"

**Machinic Enslavement vs. Social Subjection**
- **Machinic enslavement**: becoming an intrinsic component piece of a technical machine, with no control over its own actions
- **Social subjection**: being subjected to information technology as a user or consumer of TV

**The Three Forms of the State**
1. **Imperial archaic States**: paradigms that constitute a machine of enslavement by overcoding already-coded flows
2. **Evolved empires, autonomous cities, feudal systems, monarchies**: proceed by subjectification and subjection, forming qualified or topical conjunctions of decoded flows
3. **Modern nation-States**: take decoding even further and are models of realization for an axiomatic or general conjugation of flows

**The Correlation Between the Three Forms of the State**
1 ⇌ 2 (internal correlation): fragmented forms presuppose the great imperial form, which they have no need to produce or accumulate for themselves
2 ⇌ 3 (internal correlation): industrial revolutions are not wanting, difference between topical conjunctions and general conjugation of decoded flows is thin
3 ⇌ 1 (necessary correlation): modern States restore the most absolute of empires by realizing an axiomatic that functions as much by machinic enslavement as by social subjection

**The Role of Politics in Axiomatics**
- Politics proceeds by experimentation, groping in the dark, injection, withdrawal, advances, retreats
- Factors of decision and prediction are limited
- No one is capable of predicting the growth in the money supply
- States are affected by coefficients of uncertainty and unpredictability
- Axiomatics in science is not a transcendent, autonomous, and decision-making power opposed to experimentation and intuition

---

#### "The Axiomatic Nature of Capitalism and Its Consequences in Politics"

**Axiomatics in Science and Capitalism**

**Characteristics of Axiomatics:**
- System that comes up against undecidable propositions
- Reordering of lines of flight in physics and mathematics
- Seals off potential escapes with official policies
- Heirs of theorematic conception of geometry

**Capitalism as an Axiomatic System:**
- Operative statements, not theoretical propositions or ideological formulas
- Primary statements, not derived from others
- Tendency to add axioms in response to new investments and profits
  * After WWI: labor market, employment, union organization, social institutions, role of State
  * After WWII: Marshall Plan, forms of assistance and lending, monetary system changes
- Multiplication of axioms when organizing domestic markets for foreign trade
- Tendency to withdraw or subtract axioms, focusing on dominant flows
  * Totalitarianism: restrict number of axioms, promoting foreign sector
    * Minimum State of anarcho-capitalism
  * Fascism (national socialism): proliferation through subtraction

**Saturation in Capitalism:**
- Confronts its own limits and displaces them simultaneously
- Totalitarian tendency: confronts limits, restricts axioms
- Social democratic tendency: displaces limits, adds axioms
- Struggles on the level of axioms involve workers and technocracy.

---

#### "Understanding the Complex Interplay of Power and Axioms in Global Politics"

**Key Concepts:**
- Axioms and their relationship to the State's public spending and international organizations
- Isomorphism vs. homogeneity of States
- Capitalist mode of production vs. socialist bureaucratic states
- Center, periphery (North-South) bipolarity
- Power of the continuum and war machine

**Axioms and their Relationship:**
- Axioms prescribe over State's public spending and international organizations
- Struggles target national and international axioms at their point of insertion in the field of immanence
- Preventing worldwide labor bureaucracy or technocracy
- Living flows versus axioms that subordinate them to centers of control

**Isomorphism vs. Homogeneity:**
- All States are isomorphic, domains of realization for capital as function of external world market
- Isomorphy implies some degree of homogeneity in present-day Europe due to tendency toward single integrated domestic market
- However, isomorphy does not guarantee homogeneity; heterogeneity exists between totalitarian and social democratic States with the same mode of production

**Capitalist vs. Socialist States:**
- Capital acts as relation of production but in noncapitalist modes for socialist states
- Difference and independence of axioms does not compromise overall consistency
- Center needs periphery (Third World) for investment and capital acquisition
- Dependence of Third World States on center is an obvious issue, but not the most important one
- Isomorphism exists between United States and some South American tyrannies
- Center-periphery bipolarity raises other problems and evades previous distinctions

**Power (puissance):**
- Axiomatic necessarily marshals power higher than it treats, a power of destruction or war
- War follows same movement as capitalism with increasing materiel war and human element becoming pure machinic enslavement
- Growing importance of constant capital in axiomatic leads to redistributions for exploitation of resources through complexes.

---

### A New Conception of Peace and Security in the Age of Capitalism

**Inverted Clausewitz's Formula: War and Peace**
- The war machine finds its new object in absolute peace of terror or deterrence (Virilio)
- Performs technoscientific capitalization
- No need for a qualified enemy, operates against unspecified enemy (individual, group, class, people, event, world)
- New conception of security as materialized war, organized insecurity, molecularized catastrophe

**Capitalist Axiomatic and the Center**
- Requires a center (constituted in the North)
- Equilibration at the center between West and East leads to disequilibrium from North to South
- Capitalism functions on unequal exchange
- Four principal flows creating problems for representatives of world economy: matter-energy, population, food, urbanization
- Axiomatic denies means to resolve these problems (circulation and distribution)
- Social democracies selectively integrate certain elements from poverty-stricken population
- Deterritorialization of center causes peripheral formations to become true centers of investment
- Center and periphery exchange determinations, strengthening and relativizing Samir Amin's theses.

---

### Minorities and the Limits of the Axiomatic

**Theory of Enslavement and the Age of Minorities**

**Masses Abandoned**:
- Masses of population are abandoned to erratic work (subcontracting, temporary, or underground economy)
- Official subsistence is assured only by State allocations and wages subject to interruption
- Tends increasingly to merge students with the "emarginati"

**Difference from Classical Subjection**:
- Subjection remained centered on labor and involved a bipolar organization (property-labor, bourgeoisie-proletariat)
- In enslavement and central dominance of constant capital, labor seems to have splintered into:
  - Intensive surplus labor that no longer takes the route of labor
  - Extensive labor that has become erratic and floating
- Totalitarian tendency to abandon axioms and social democratic tendency to multiply statutes can combine but effect class ruptures

**Minorities**:
- Ours is becoming the age of minorities
- Minorities are not defined by smallness of numbers but by becoming or a line of fluctuation, in other words, by the gap that separates them from this or that axiom (Ulysses, or today's average, urban European)
- A minority can be small in number; but it can also be the largest in number, constitute an absolute, indefinite majority

**Characteristics of Minorities**:
- Distinguished from majorities by the relations internal to the number, which is a nondenumerable set
- This connection or production between elements and sets eludes the axiomatic and constitutes a line of flight
- Axiomatic manipulates only denumerable sets (even infinite), while minorities are "fuzzy, nondenumerable, nonaxiomizable sets"

**Minority as a Universal Figure**:
- Woman: we all have to become that, whether male or female
- Non-white: we all have to become that, whether white, yellow, or black
- Struggle around axioms manifests the gap between two types of propositions - propositions of flow and propositions of axioms

**Power of Minorities**:
- Not measured by their capacity to enter and make themselves felt within the majority system
- But by bringing to bear the force of non-denumerable sets against denumerable (even infinite) sets
- Issue is not anarchy versus organization or centralism vs. decentralization, but a calculus of problems in nondenumerable sets

---

### Challenging Capitalism's Limits

**Capitalism and the War Machine**
- Capitalist axiomatic produces and reproduces what war machine tries to exterminate (individuals, groups, peoples)
- Famine multiplies starving as much as it kills them; same for concentration camps
- Extermination of minority engenders a minority of that minority
- Difficult to liquidate a people or group, even in Third World, with enough connections to the axiomatic
- Minorities do not receive better solution by integration, even with statutes or independence
- Their tactics go that route, and can be revolutionary if they challenge the worldwide axiomatic
- Power of minority lies in proletariat, but working class must leave capital's plan to be truly revolutionary
- Capital continually sets and then repels its own limits, creating nondenumerable sets that disrupt models
- Constructivism opposes automation of capitalist axioms and bureaucratic programming
- Undecidable propositions refer to coexistence of system's conjugations and that which escapes it
- Every struggle is a function of these undecidable propositions, constructing revolutionary connections.

## 14. 1440: The Smooth and the Striated

**Smooth vs Striated Spaces**

**Characteristics of Striated Space (Fabric):**
- Consists of two parallel elements: warp and woof
- Vertical and horizontal elements intertwine perpendicularly
- Different functions: fixed vs mobile
- Delimited, closed on at least one side
- Necessarily has a top and bottom
- Used in governing people or operating the State apparatus

**Characteristics of Smooth Space (Felt):**
- No separation of threads, no intertwining
- Entanglement of fibers obtained by fulling
- Infinite, open, unlimited in every direction
- Has neither top nor bottom nor center
- Not homogeneous
- Used for tents, clothes, and armor among nomads

**Interfacings between Felt and Fabric:**
- Knitting: needles produce a striated space
- Crochet: draws an open space in all directions
- Embroidery vs patchwork: significant distinction
  - Embroidery: central theme or motif, complex variables and constants
  - Patchwork: no center, basic motif composed of single element, frees rhythmic values distinct from harmonies

**Quilt:**
- Two layers of fabric stitched together with a filler in between
- Can have no top or bottom
- History shows shift from embroidery (plain quilts) to patchwork (applique and pieced quilts) due to scarcity of textiles and popularity of Indian chintz.

#### "Exploring the Distinctions Between Smooth and Striated Spaces in Music and Navigation"

**Smooth vs. Striated Space: Musical Model (Pierre Boulez)**
- Smooth space: occupy without counting, nonmetric multiplicity, directional or dimensional spaces
- Striated space: count in order to occupy, metric multiplicity, fixed and homogeneous values

**Smooth vs. Striated Space: Maritime Model**
- In smooth space: points subordinated to trajectory; haptic perception; intensive space
- In striated space: lines subordinated to points; optical perception; extensive space

**Music Composition with Boulez's Concepts:**
- Smooth space: continuous variation, fusion of harmony and melody, production of rhythmic values
- Striated space: intertwines fixed and variable elements, order and succession of distinct forms

**Navigational Systems:**
- Nomadic navigation based on wind, noise, colors, and sounds (smooth)
- Preastronomical or astronomical navigation using only latitude (translatable generalization lacking)
- Improvements under special conditions in Indian Ocean and Atlantic (straight and curved spaces)

**Sea as Archetype of All Smooth Spaces:**
- First to encounter demands of strict striation through navigation on open water
- Gradual striation gridding the sea: latitude lines, maps.

---

### A Duality of Spaces and Movements

**The Relationship Between Smooth and Striated Spaces**

**Smooth vs. Striated Spaces**:
- Distinguished by an inverse relation between points and lines
- In smooth space, directionality is subordinated or superimposed upon it
- In striated space, surfaces are closed off and allocated according to determinate intervals

**Examples of Smooth vs. Striated Spaces**:
- The sea (archetype of smooth space) was the site of contest between smooth and striated spaces
- The city is the striated space par excellence, while the sea is a smooth space fundamentally open to striation
- Farmers and nomads operate in both smooth and striated spaces

**Challenges in Differentiating Smooth vs. Striated Spaces**:
- Even in the city, one can experience "tree travel" or "rhizome travel" in a smooth manner
- Not all movement coincides with either smooth or striated travel
- The differences are not objective, and can intermingle or cross over

**Voyages and Spaces**:
- Voyage is not just about physical movement, but also the "mode of spatialization" and "manner of being in space"
- Nomads do not always move physically; they can also hold a smooth space and refuse to leave it.

---

### The Smooth and the Striated

**The Smooth and the Striated**

**Intersections of Smooth and Striated Spaces**:
- Kings of the Road film: Intersects paths of two characters
- One takes a "Goethean journey" through striated space, the other experiments in smooth space
- The "former opens space for himself and performs a kind of retroactive smoothing", while the latter's space reforms around him

**Riemann's Contribution**:
- Mathematician who made multiplicity a noun rather than a predicate state
- Marked the end of dialectics and beginning of typology/topology of multiplicities

**Types of Multiplicities**:
- **Metric multiplicity**: Allows measurement, striation (e.g., magnitude)
- **Nonmetric multiplicity**: Cannot be measured directly, requires indirect means (e.g., distance)
- Differences between metric and nonmetric multiplicities: Magnitudes vs. distances, divisibility, nature change at division

**Bergson's Contribution**:
- Presented duration as a type of multiplicity opposed to metric multiplicity
- Durations cannot be divided without changing in nature
- Bergson brought light to qualitative and fusional multiplicities versus numerical and homogeneous discrete multiplicities

**The Number and Smooth Spaces**:
- The number is the correlate of metric space
- Nonmetric multiplicities or smooth spaces pertain to a minor geometry that is purely operative and qualitative
- However, the independence of this ametric geometry allows for the distribution of the unit and ordinal, directional, nomadic numbers in smooth space.

---

### Fractals and Translations

**Riemannian Space: Smooth vs Striated**

**Smooth Space**:
- Enveloping or enveloped character, where determinations are part of one another without exact magnitude or common unit
- Situation precludes comparison between neighboring observers
- Amorphous collection of pieces juxtaposed but not attached to each other
- Connections, or tactile relations, with rhythmic values not found elsewhere
- Pure patchwork

**Striated Space**:
- Metric spaces with homogeneity and relation between neighboring observers defined
- Translation from smooth space necessary for understanding and analysis by major science
- Involves complex operations like translating intensities into extensive quantities or Riemannian patches receiving Euclidean conjunction (parallelism)

**Fractals**:
- Aggregates with fractional number of dimensions rather than whole or continuous variation in direction
- Examples: Von Koch's curve, Sierpinsky's sponge and rug
- Infinite length but finite total volume, approaching zero while lateral surface infinitely grows
- Dimension lies between a surface (2) and a volume (3), representing smooth space.

---

### Beyond Striated and Homogeneous Models

**Smooth Space vs Striated Space**

**Definition of Smooth Space:**
- Nonmetric space with fractional dimensions greater than one or two
- Constituted by an accumulation of proximities, defining zones of indiscernibility
- Space and occupier tend to become identified
- Made up of amorphous, continuous variation exceeding distribution of constants and variables
- Link between homogeneous and striated can be expressed in terms of physics model

**Physics Model:**
1. Striation of space with parallel gravitational verticals (fixed elements)
2. Resultant force applied to center of gravity point
3. Position unchanged when direction changes, creating universal attraction following straight lines
4. Definition of work as force-displacement relation
5. Increasingly perfect striated space in all directions
6. Limits reached with infinite or infinitely small, and consideration of multiple bodies

**Smooth Space: Declination vs Vortex**
1. Escapes limits by declination: smallest deviation from vertical
2. Escapes limits by vortex: figure occupying space according to laws of frequency or accumulation
3. Relation between clinamen (generative differential element) and formation of turbulences in smooth space
4. Ancient atom is misunderstood without consideration of hydraulics and swells/flows
5. Coincidence between Archimedean geometry and Democritean physics
6. War machine ultimately metamorphoses into a tool for peace in smooth space

**Work-Model:**
1. Twofold elaboration during 19th century: physicoscientific concept of work, socioeconomic concept of labor-power
2. Profound link between physics and sociology through wage regime and mechanics of force
3. Impose Work-model on every activity, translate free action into possible or virtual work
4. Discipline free action or relegate it to leisure
5. Fundamental part of State apparatus.

---

### From Striation to Smoothness in Society and Art

**Nomad Art and the Physicsocial Model of Work**

**Standard-man**:
- Began as the man of public works
- Problems of abstract labor, multiplication of results, and division of operations were first formulated in public construction and army organization (war machine)

**War Machine vs. State Apparatus**:
- The war machine itself did not imply normalization
- But the state apparatus subjugated the war machine before all else to the Work-model of construction sites and factories
- War machine was the first thing to be "striated," producing abstract labor-time for multiplication and division of operations
- This led to the conquest of free action in "smooth space"

**The Physicosocial Model of Work**:
- The physicosocial model of work pertains to the state apparatus, as it was one of its inventions
- Labor appears only when there is a surplus, so all labor begins with "surplus labor"
- Labor performs a generalized operation of "striation," subjecting free action and nullifying smooth spaces

**Counterdemonstration: No Work in Primitive Societies**:
- Some ethnologists argue that "primitive societies" are not societies of shortage or subsistence, but societies of free action and smooth space
- These societies do not have a concept of work as it is understood today
- Their differences with the law are expressed in the form of anarchy, rather than a hierarchical state structure

**Transition from Imperial Work to Capitalist Labor**:
- In capitalist regimes, surplus labor becomes less distinguishable from labor itself
- Surplus labor no longer requires human labor, as it can be generated through machines and other systems (e.g., children, retirees)
- The user as a "worker" tends to become an employee, while capitalism operates on modes of transportation, urban models, media, entertainment, etc.

**Nomad Art: Close Vision and Haptic Space**:
- Nomad art is characterized by close vision and haptic space (tactile/haptic senses)
- The "Smooth" refers to the object of close vision and the element of haptic space

---

### A Visual and Perceptual Analysis

**Striated vs. Smooth Space**

**Smooth Space**:
- Characterized by: continuous variation in orientations, landmarks, and linkages
- Operates step-by-step
- Examples include desert, sea, ice
- Orientations are not constant but change according to temporary conditions
- No visual model for points of reference, tied to nomadic observers
- Interlinkages are constituted by ordered differences that give rise to intrinsic variations in distance

**Striated Space**:
- Defined by requirements of long-distance vision:
  - Constancy of orientation, in variance of distance through interchangeable points of reference
  - Interlinkage by immersion in an ambient milieu
  - Constitution of a central perspective

**Comparison between Smooth and Striated Space**:
- Smooth space is the global relative to the local absolute, while striated space is the local absolute to the global
- In smooth space, the eye has a haptic, nonoptical function: no line separates earth from sky, no horizon or perspective
- In striated space, the absolute becomes the horizon or background, and form appears against this background

**Imperial Religions and Smooth Space**:
- Imperial religions need smooth space (e.g., desert) to impose law that is opposed to the nomos in every way
- This involves reducing smooth space to an encompassing horizon and expelling it from the relative encompassed element

---

### Smooth Space and Becoming

**Nomad Art and Abstract Line**

**Importance of Nomads:**
- Intermediary between East and North with their own specificity
- Not reducible to empires or migrations
- Essential vector of communication between cultures

**Abstract Line:**
- Fundamental concept in art history (Worringer)
- Two types: abstract line vs. imperial lines
- Abstract line: smooth space, multiple orientations, positively motivated by the space it draws
- Opposed to figurative but not directly opposed
- Can be found in primitive art from the beginning

**Impact of Writing:**
- When writing exists, abstract line tends to become concrete or figurative
- Children forget how to draw in absence of writing

**Imperial Lines vs. Abstract Line:**
- Convert abstract line, rend it from smooth space
- Part of originality and irreducibility of nomad art
- Figurative not inherent to any will to art
- Defining characteristics: transversals subordinated to diagonals, etc. (striated space) vs. mutant line passing between points (smooth space).

**Nomads:**
- Intermediary between East and North
- Reducible neither to empires nor migrations
- Essential vector of communication between cultures: Goths, Sarmatians, Huns
- Smooth space vs. striated space in art: haptic function and close vision (smooth) vs. optical function and distant vision (striated).

**Abstract Line:**
- Fundamental concept in art history (Worringer)
- Two types: abstract line vs. imperial lines
- Abstract line: smooth space, multiple orientations, positively motivated by the space it draws
- Opposed to figurative but not directly opposed
- Can be found in primitive art from the beginning

**Impact of Writing:**
- When writing exists, abstract line tends to become concrete or figurative
- Children forget how to draw when there is no need for a writing system of their own.

**Imperial Lines vs. Abstract Line:**
- Convert abstract line, rend it from smooth space
- Part of originality and irreducibility of nomad art
- Figurative not inherent to any will to art
- Defining characteristics: transversals subordinated to diagonals, etc. (striated space) vs. mutant line passing between points (smooth space).

### The Interplay of Smooth and Striated Spaces in Art and Thought

**Rectilinear Systems and Repetition:**
- Symmetry limits repetition in rectilinear systems, preventing infinite progression
- Free action allows for repetition as a "machinic force" that multiplies its effect
- Free action proceeds by disjunction and decentering, or peripheral movement
- Disjointed polythetism vs. symmetrical antithetism

**Abstract vs. Organic:**
- Worringer's contrast between abstract and organic:
  - Abstract does not designate something represented but the form of representation itself
  - Formal processes in art correspond to natural, organic tendencies in humans
- Rectilinear (geometrical) cannot be opposed to organic in this sense
- Organic body is prolonged by straight lines that attach it to distance

**Abstract vs. Geometric:**
- Worringer's "Gothic avatar" as the beginning of the abstract
- Abstract line unravels, coils into ribbons; mouths curl in spirals
- Streaming, spiraling, zigzagging, snaking, feverish line of variation liberates life force
- Nomad art: ornamental abstract line and animal motifs are a single will or becoming
- Pure animality can combine with abstraction due to being inorganic or supraorganic

**Abstract Line vs. Organic Line:**
- Abstract line is not geometrical and rectilinear, but a variable direction that describes no contour or form
- Smooth space vs. striated space: passages and combinations of forces at work within space.

## 15. Conclusion: Concrete Rules and Abstract Machines

**Strata and Stratification**
- Phenomena of thickening on the Earth's Body
- Simultaneously molecular and molar: accumulations, coagulations, sedimentations, foldings
- Three major strata: physicochemical, organic, anthropomorphic or alloplastic
- Each stratum consists of coded milieus and formed substances
- Forms and substances, codes and milieus are not really distinct but abstract components of every articulation
- A given stratum retains a unity of composition despite diversity in organization and development
- Strata are extremely mobile, capable of serving as substratum or colliding with each other independently of evolutionary order
- Interstratic phenomena: transcodings between milieus, intermixing, rhythms
- Stratification is a continual renewed creation

**Destratification and Assemblages**
- Every undertaking to go beyond the strata (destratification) must observe concrete rules of extreme caution
- A too-sudden destratification may be suicidal or turn cancerous, ending in chaos or locking back into strata
- **Assemblages**: produced in the strata but operate in decoded milieu zones
- Assemblies are territorial and envelop a specific territory (home)
- Content and expression of each assemblage must be evaluated for real distinction, reciprocal presupposition, piecemeal insertions
- Assemblages belong to the strata but have a new relation between content and expression: a semiotic system (regime of signs) and pragmatic system (actions and passions)
- Assemblies are divided along two axes: territoriality (content, expression included) and lines of deterritorialization that carry it away.

---

### Territoriality, Deterritorialization, and the Plane of Consistency

**Assemblages and Lines: Types and Characteristics**

**Types of Assemblages:**
- Based on territoriality and deterritorialization
- Complexes of lines, with two main kinds: molar and molecular

**Molar Assemblages:**
- Line is subordinated to the point
- Forms a contour, constitutes striated space
- Multiplicities are countable, ordered relations
- Expressed by psychosis or schizophrenia at the level of pathos
- Utilized by sorcery at the level of pragmatics
- Theory correlated to smooth spaces

**Molecular Assemblages:**
- Diagonal frees itself and passes between things
- No longer forms a contour, belongs to smooth space
- Multiplicities are anomalous, nomadic, transformational
- Expressed by psychosis and schizophrenia at the level of pathos
- Utilized by sorcery at the level of pragmatics
- Theory correlated to smooth spaces

**Plane of Consistency (Planomenon):**
- Opposed to plane of organization and development
- Concerns form and substance: haecceities, events, incorporeal transformations
- Consists of relations between unformed elements, intensive affects
- Assures consolidation of fuzzy aggregates (multiplicities)
- Inscribed on the plane are bodies without organs or plates (plateaus)
- Body without organs and plane are interconnected through lines that increase/decrease in fractional order.

---

### A Deconstructive Approach

**Deterritorialization**
- Movement of leaving territory or "plane" (mode of connection)
- Can be overlaid by compensatory reterritorialization, obstructing the line of flight (negative D)
- Reterritorialization can stand for lost territory and is not limited to physical objects
- Deterritorialization itself is inseparable from correlative reterritorializations
- Negative or relative D conforms to second case: obstructs lines of flight through principal or secondary reterritorializations
- Absolute D creates new earth by connecting lines of flight and drawing a plane of consistency (creates smooth space)

**Relations Between Deterritorialization, Territory, Reterritorialization, and Earth**
- Territory inseparable from vectors of deterritorialization working within it
- Deterritorialization in turn inseparable from correlative reterritorializations
- Relative movement relates a body considered as One to a striated space through which it moves, while absolute movement relates multiple body to smooth space
- Earth is not opposite of D but rather Deterritorialization par excellence; creates new land or universe by connecting lines of flight

**Forms of Deterritorialization**
- At least four forms: negative, relative (effective), positive, and absolute
- Negative or relative D conforms to second case, obstructs or segments lines of flight
- Absolute D creates new earth, connects lines of flight, raises them to the power of an abstract vital line

**Abstract Machines**
- No transcendent, universal, eternal abstract machines
- Operate within concrete assemblages and make territorial assemblage open onto something else (molecular, cosmic)
- Constitute becomings
- Always singular and immanent
- Opposed to abstract in ordinary sense, surpass any kind of mechanics.

#### "Exploring the Nature and Function of Abstract Machines in Philosophy and Technology"

**Abstract Machines and Planes of Consistency**

**Components of Abstract Machines**:
- Unformed matters and nonformal functions (phylum and diagram)
- Composed of intensive qualities like resistance, conductivity, heating, stretching, speed or delay, induction, transduction
- Diagrammatic functions exhibiting differential equations or tensors

**Distinction Between Content and Expression**:
- Abstract machines do not refer to forms or substances
- Plane of consistency is a plane of continuous variation
- Distinction between content and expression is irrelevant due to the nature of abstract machines

**Deterritorialization and Absolute Deterritorialization**:
- Deterritorializing element and deterri-torialized element allocated to content and expression, respectively
- Both content and expression affected by continuous variation but have distinct roles in becoming or flow

**Singularities of Abstract Machines**:
- Dated and named (e.g., Einstein, Webern, Galileo, Bach, Beethoven)
- Refers to people or effectuating moments only indirectly

**Role of Names and Dates**:
- Refer to the singularities of abstract machines and what they effectuate

**Abstract Machine as Transcendent Model**:
- Abstract idea of the machine used as a model for concrete assemblages
- Coefficients quantify varying assemblage components, entangled lines, and relations to plane of consistency (phylum and diagram)
- War machine vs. State apparatus: different in nature and quantifiable in relation to abstract machine
- Writing and music can be war machines when drawing a plane of consistency with increasing connections.

**Quantitative Analysis of Abstract Machines**:
- Schizoanalysis analyzes abstract machines in relation to assemblages
- Quantitative analysis of assemblages in relation to pure abstract machine

**Typological Analysis**:
- General types of abstract machines exist beyond the operations on the plane of consistency.

#### "Exploring the Role of Abstract Machines in Assemblages and the Interconnected Nature of Different Planes of Reality"

**The Three Types of Abstract Machines**
- **Abstract machines of consistency**: Stratum has a unity of composition, relating to substantial elements and formal traits, indicating the presence of an abstract machine governing that plane.
- **Alloplastic strata abstract machines**: Compensate for deterritorializations by providing reterritorializations and overcodings; useful for assemblages on alloplastic strata.
  - Examples: Order-word machine overcodes language, faciality machine overcodes the body and head, machine of enslavement axiomatizes the earth.
- **Axiomatic or overcoding abstract machines**: Perform totalizations, homogenizations, and conjunctions of closure.
  - Linked to other abstract machines due to their interconnectedness in politics, economics, science, art, ecology, cosmology, perception, affect, action, thinking, and physics/semiotics.

**The Mechanosphere**
- Assemblages cannot be placed on a quantitative scale based on distance from the plane of consistency.
- Different types of abstract machines overlap in their operations and qualify assemblages: abstract machines of consistency (singular & mutant), stratification, and axiomatic/overcoding.
- Abstract machines are interconnected due to their political, economic, scientific, artistic, ecological, cosmic functions, among others.
