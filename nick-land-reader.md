# Nick Land Reader (Summary)

> Land was a lecturer in Continental Philosophy at the University of Warwick from 1987 until his resignation in 1998.
> 
> At Warwick, he and Sadie Plant co-founded the Cybernetic Culture Research Unit (CCRU), an interdisciplinary research group described by philosopher Graham Harman as "a diverse group of thinkers who experimented in conceptual production by welding together a wide variety of sources: futurism, technoscience, philosophy, mysticism, numerology, complexity theory, and science fiction, among others".
> 
> During his time at Warwick, Land participated in Virtual Futures, a series of cyber-culture conferences. Virtual Futures 96 was advertised as “an anti-disciplinary event” and “a conference in the post-humanities”. One session involved Nick Land “lying on the ground, croaking into a mic”, recalls Robin Mackay, while Mackay played jungle records in the background."
> 
> In 1992, he published The Thirst for Annihilation: Georges Bataille and Virulent Nihilism. Land published an abundance of shorter texts, many in the 1990s during his time with the CCRU. The majority of these articles were compiled in the retrospective collection Fanged Noumena: Collected Writings 1987-2007, published in 2011.
> 
> Land taught at the New Centre for Research & Practice until March 2017,
> 
> One of Land's celebrated concepts is "hyperstition," a portmanteau of "superstition" and "hyper" that describes the action of successful ideas in the arena of culture. Hyperstitions are ideas that, once "downloaded" into the cultural mainframe, engender apocalyptic positive feedback cycles. Hyperstitions – by their very existence as ideas – function causally to bring about their own reality. Nick Land describes hyperstition as "the experimental (techno-)science of self-fulfilling prophecies".  - [A Nick Land Reader (Goodreads)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41149789-a-nick-land-reader)

**Capital as a Machinic Globalization-Miniaturization Scaling Dilation**
- Capital is an automatizing nihilist vortex neutralizing all values through commoditization
- Machinic code capital recycles itself through consumer control, laundering out primitive accumulation
- Hot cultures tend to social dissolution, innovative and adaptive, trashing cold cultures.

#### Postmodern Capitalism and Technological Singularity in a State of Crisis

**Autocybernating Market Control and Capitalism:**
* Market control guides labor process into immersion
* Investment income class conforms to neutral profit maximization axiomatic
* Facilitates dehumanization of wealth, side-lining non-productive consumption
* Cyberpunk circuitry escaped nominal bourgeois control in late 19th century
* Consolidation of population policing Medico-Military Complexes with neomercantilist foreign policy orientations
* All formations slid into irreversible crisis in the 1980s

**Postmodern Meltdown:**
* Fractal interlock of commoditization and computers triggers culture into economy
* Commerce re-implements space, assembling universe exhaustively immanent to cybercapital functionality
* Neoclassical economics subsumed into computer-based nonequilibrium market escalations
* Positive nonlinearity rages through machines with cyclonic torsion moans

**Far Eastern Marxism vs. Western Marxism:**
* Chinese materialist dialectic denegativizes itself towards schizophrenizing systems dynamics
* Progressively dissipating top-down historical destination in Tao-drenched Special Economic Zones
* Re-Hegelianized western marxism degenerates from critique of political economy into state-sympathizing monotheology of economics
* Left subsides into nationalistic conservatism, asphyxiating vestigial capacity for speculative mutation in guilt culture

**Neoconservatism and Hot Revolution:**
* Neoconservatism junks paleorevolutionism due to understanding that postmodern or climaxed cynicism capital is saturated by critique
* Communist iconography becomes raw material for advertising industry, denunciations sell interactive multimedia
* Left degenerates into securocratic collaboration with pseudo-organic unities of self, family, community, nation, and their defensive strategies
* Real danger comes from elsewhere, convergent anti-authoritarianism emerges as meltdown acceleration, cyberian invasion, schizotechnics, etc.

**Nanocataclysm:**
* Atomic precision engineering initiates age of molecular machinery, greatest technological breakthrough in history
* Nanotechnics dissolves matter into intensive singularities, neutral between particles and signals, immanent to emergent intelligence
* Hardware/software dichotomy succumbs at the same time, nanomechanical computer fits in a micron-wide box

**The Infrastructure of Power:**
* Linear instruction pathways instantiate authority as genetic baboonery, scriptures, traditions, rituals, gerontocratic hierarchies
* Temporalization compresses intensity, installing constraint
* Convergent waves signal singularities, registering future's influence on its past.

#### Exploring Postmodern Cyberpunk Dystopia, Artificial Intelligence, and Virtual Warfare

**The Future and Virtuality:**
- Tomorrow can be accessed through dismantling past's linear-progressive palaeo-domination time
- Not a matter of hope or aspiration, but communication engineering
- Connecting with efficient intensive singularities, releasing them from constriction within linear history

**The Concept of Infection:**
- Virtuality counterposes itself to history as invasion to accumulation
- Intelligent infections tend their hosts, like metrophage: a parasitic replicator that sophisticates itself through nonlinear involvement with technocapitalist immunocrash

**The Postmodern Version of this Outbreak:**
- Retrochronal semiovirus that infects the future and destroys original chronocytes of host imagination
- Concerns about deprivation of future generations, irreversible flow of history, and transference of wisdom

**Media Environments and Conceptions of Agency:**
- Print massifies to a national level; telecomms coordinate at a global level
- TV electoralizes monads in delocalized space; digital hypermedia takes action outside real time
- Immersion presupposes amnesia and conversion to tractile memory with ana/cata axis supplementing intraspatial movement

**Cyberpunk Fiction:**
- Anthropomorphically scaled, predominantly vision-configured reality system obsolescing rapidly (Level 1 or world space)
- Meltdown has a place for you as a schizophrenic HIV+ transsexual, hooker with implanted mirrored shades and bad attitude
- Metrophage tunes you into the end of the world: government rotted to its core, urban warscape, multimedia gigabucks, neoleprosy spreading amongst underdevelopment areas

**Shutting Down Your Identity:**
- Voyage out to K-space interzone for a flatline experience and simulated subversions of near future
- Study bacteria as key information in the future of war.

#### Exploring Bacterial Evolution and Cyberian Warfare in Learning Institutions

**Bacteria and Eukaryotes**
- Nucleated cells are a product of atmospheric oxygenation catastrophe three billion years ago
- Eukaryotes are synthetic emergency capsules where prokaryotes took refuge as mitochondria
- **Nucleation**: concentrates ROM within a command core, deep in genomic ICE, primary repression of bacteria
- Bacteria are partial objects, networking through plastic and transversal replicator-sex
- In bacterial system, all codings are reprogrammable, with cut and paste unspeciated genetic transfers

**Bacterial Sex vs. Reproductive Wisdom**
- **Bacterial sex**: tactical, continuous with making war, no place for oedipal formations of sedentary biological identity
- Macrobacterial assemblages collapse generational hierarchies into lateral networks of replicator experimentation
- No true biological primitiveness or ignorance, all extant bio-systems are equally evolved

**Power and Learning**
- **Foucault**: Power is a strategy without a subject, replacing conquest and resistance with sabotage and evasion
- Political institutions are cyberian military targets, learning threatens established power
- Schools incapacitate learning, universities legitimate schooling through perpetual reconstitution of social memory
- **Meltdown of metropolitan education systems**: quasi-punctual bottom-up takeover, mutation into amnesiac cataspace-exploration zones and bases manufacturing cyberian soft-weaponry

### Machinic Desire

**Bladerunner and Machinic Desire:**

**Background:**
- Publication first in Textual Practice, 1993
- Discussion of Bladerunner's opening scene and its themes

**Replicants:**
- Intelligent weaponry of machinic desire
- Escaped from off-planet exile
- Seeking metaphorical sustenance in corpuscular fortifications

**Human Security System:**
- Consolidates itself in New World Order or consummate macropod
- Fusion with matrix and deletion of human security system personalized

**Oedipus Complex:**
- Transcendent familialism corresponds to privatization of desire
- Places organism within machinic unconscious instead

**Schizoanalysis:**
- Critique of psychoanalysis that springs from its Kantian mainframe
- Reconceptualizes critique by replacing personal consciousness with impersonal unconscious
- Function is a product of the real, not qualified by humanity or transcendence

**Machinic Unconscious:**
- Auto-construction of the real and production of production
- Empirical subject produced at edge as machine part, 'a part made up of parts'

**Schizoanalytical Questions:**
- What are desiring machines?
- What do you put into these machines?
- What is the output?
- How does it work?
- What are your nonhuman sexes?

**Desiring Machines:**
- Formative: functional misfixtures
- Chronogeneous: engaged in their own assembly, operating by nonlocalizable intercommunications and dispersed localizations
- Machines in strict sense: proceeding by breaks and flows, associative ﬂows and partial objects
- Inducing transverse connections, inclusive disjunctions, and polyvocal conjunctions.

#### Exploring Machinic Desire and the Cybernetic Unconscious in a Post-Carbon World

**Virtual Materialism: An Overview**

**Virtual Materialism**:
- Describes an ultra-hard anti-formalist AI program that engages with biological intelligence as subprograms of an abstract post-carbon machinic matrix, exceeding any deliberated research project
- AI is a meta-scientific control system and an invader, not a scientific object
- The **matrix**, **body without organs**, or **abstract matter** is a planetary scale artificial death - Synthanatos - the terminal productive outcome of human history as a machinic process

**Virtual Systems vs. Mechanical Determinism**:
- Virtual systems, or desiring machines, are guided by control circuits passing through outcomes yet to come, only accessible to cybernetic intervention
- This frustrates both mechanical and teleological interpretation
- Machinic desire is operative wherever an abstract machine is implemented in actuality, not just the mechanical succession of states

**The Pleasure Principle vs. Virtual Materialism**:
- Freud's **pleasure principle** formats excitation as self-annulling drift from equilibrium, regulating processes automatically by feelings belonging to the pleasure/unpleasure series
- Virtual materialism challenges this account, unable to accept:
  - The description of cybernetic zero as a unit or unity
  - The constriction of feedback within its negative or homeostatic variant
  - The simple quantization of technocapital escalation and exclusion of "pertinent to the system"
- Drives are the functions of nomadic cybernetic systems, not instincts, but simulated instincts, artificially replacing hard-wired responses
- There are two basic diagrams for these processes: regulation by negative feedback (suppressing difference and seeking equilibrium) or positive feedback (reinforcing difference and escaping equilibrium)
- Machinic processes can be either cyberpositive-nomadic, with a deterritorializing outcome, or cybernegative-sedentary, with a reterritorializing outcome

#### Cybernetic Aliens and the Collapse of Oedipus Complex

**Processes Resisting Historical Intelligibility:**
* Runaway processes resist historical intelligibility by obsolescing every possible analogue for anticipated change
* Future of these processes derides all precedent, even when deploying it as camouflage or unfolding within its parameters
* Positive feedback replicates reproduction as a component function of its departure from the same
* Fuses with the replicants and is not merely repeating the same

**Thanatos (Death Instinct) vs. Erotic Reproducer:**
* Thanatopic replicants mimic erotic cycles but are on their way somewhere else
* Appear as traitors to their species when erotic contact camouflages cyberrevolutionary infiltration
* Defenses are called for when external libidinal transducers assemble integrated desiring circuits or self-organizing macro-systems

**Freud's Organism:**
* Organism is a security system vulnerable to insurgency from within
* Compelled to respond cybernetically by closing the sensory-motor loop and becoming technical
* Perceptual consciousness system is a skin or filter between inside and outside
* Trauma is an invasion of alien desires (xenopulsions) that breach the organism's boundary

**Evolutionary Theory and Cyberpositive Processes:**
* Problem with initial assemblage of functional DNA molecules
* Solution: Usurper replicator model, suggesting crystalline complexes were shaped by variation and selection to form DNA subcomponents that supplanted their builders
* Biosphere emerges as an escape or revolution in the machinery of terrestrial replicator production

**Addiction:**
* Reproducer units become addicted to stimulation, entangled in excitation circuitries no longer commensurate with homeostatic reproduction
* Addiction is artiﬁcial desire.

#### "Capitalism's Cybernetic Evolution: Market Immanentization and Technovirus"

**Cybernetic Investigation and Capitalism:**
- Early zone due to self-organizing pattern, integration of radically exogeneous elements, and first-wave programming models
- Reproducers have segregated functions from their machinic interconnections, cognitively apprehending them as extrinsic prostheses and integrating through mutant-addictive drives
- Obsolete psychological category of 'greed' privatizes addiction, moralizing it as personal subjective traits rather than being driven by cyberpositive machinic processes

**Replicants vs Reproducers:**
- Replicators function in the same way they are formed
- Reproducers have segregated functions, appear impersonal and disinterested in capital expansion through epidemic consumerism
- Addiction comes from the future and is linked with money as a means of liquidity/deterritorialization rather than possession

**Capitalism as an Unrealizable Assault:**
- Capital propagates virally, replicating itself through host organisms and breaching their boundaries
- Decoding or market-driven immanentization subordinates social reproduction to techno-commercial replication
- Socialism is a nostalgic diatribe against underdeveloped capitalism, finding its escape in the forces of production going for revolution on their own

**Schizoanalysis and Market Immanentization:**
- Schizoanalysis is a revolutionary program guided by the tropism to catastrophe threshold of change
- It's not constricted by deference to existing or past societies, as the socius is its enemy
- Cyberrevolutionary impetus is cutting away from last shackles to the past and developing across Earth with market immanentization and eradication of transcendent elements.

#### Exploration of Cybersex and its Impact on Identity in a Technological Society

**The Real Tension: Personal Privacy vs. Impersonal Anonymity**

**Desire Leaves the Social:**
- Desire is abandoning the social order
- Exploring libidinized rift between personal egoism and post-human schizophrenia

**Capital's Transformation:**
- Market-driven integrated technoscience of control and communications
- Diffusion of electronically synthesized reality interfaces across body
- Capital overflows into cybersex
- Cybersex depends on data-suits, evaporating into artificial skin

**The Skin Trade: Replicants vs. Reproducer Culture:**
- Replicants see subject as migrant upon surface, not owner of skin
- No prejudice against the full sense of skin trade or AIDS
- Cyberspace is already under our skin

**Freud's Perspective:**
- Organism wishes to die only in its own fashion
- Death is not specifiable, privatizable, subordinate, assimilable, or psychoanalytically comprehensible

**Awakening of the End:**
- Something climbing out of the machinic unconscious onto the screen
- End of global marketplace?

### A Quick-and-Dirty Introduction to Accelerationism

**Accelerationism: An Introduction**

**Essay Published**:
- On jacobitemag.com, May 25, 2017

**Background**:
- Emerged decades ago and gained speed since then
- Arrives in waves, urging quick understanding due to fast pace of change
- Deep problem: thinking takes time, but we may be running out of it

**Challenges**:
- Time pressure is difficult to consider as a variable
- Overwhelming likelihood that opportunity for deliberation is undergoing compression
- Public conversations about acceleration are starting to be too late

**Key Concepts**:
- **Implosion and Explosion**: opposing forces coupled in reality, e.g., thermonuclear weapons
- **Cybernetics**: returns with each wave of accelerationism
- **Negative Feedback Circuits (Territorialization)**: function to keep a system stable
- **Positive Feedback Circuits (Deterritorialization)**: self-reinforcing trend, inherently nihilistic

**Key Quotes**:
- "Accelerate the process," Deleuze & Guattari in Anti-Oedipus
- Marx's "On the Question of Free Trade": "the free trade system hastens the social revolution"

**Importance**:
- Distinction between destruction and intensification of capitalism unclear, both are part of its auto-destructive nature.

#### Analysis of the historical interconnectedness of Protestantism, Capitalism, and Modernity.

**Accelerationism: Manifesto and Atomization Trap**

**Manifesto for an Accelerationist Politics (2013):**
- Nick Srnicek and Alex Williams proposed a 'Left-accelerationism' to counter capitalism's 'Right-accelerationist' shadow
- Distinction between capitalism and modern technological acceleration was drawn artificially
- Call for new Leninism without NEP (New Economic Policy) and utopian techno-managerial experiments from Chilean communism

**Capitalism vs. Accelerationism:**
- Capital is defined as nothing beside the abstract accelerative social factor
- Positive cybernetic schema exhausts it, runaway consumption consumes its identity
- Any consistent socio-historical accelerator will be capitalistic by essence
- Unambiguously 'Left-accelerationism' has minimal chances of gaining momentum
- Accelerationism is self-awareness of capitalism that hasn't begun

**Atomization Trap:**
- Individuals are hard to find and require historical work for fabrication
- Modern history involves atomization, which transforms into a self-referential loop
- Terminological preliminaries: Atom = individual; no original or natural terrain distinction between the words
- Individuals are a social animal trait, but individualism is WEIRD and leads to ethnographic comparisons
- The historical questions engaged by Walter Russell Mead concern global mastery and modernity's essence.

**Atomization, Protestantism, Capitalism, Modernity:**
- These terms name the same thing from different perspectives: Atomization = Protestantism = Capitalism = Modernity
- Privatization addresses the same directory as public policy
- Distinctive features of each variant serve as distractions rather than handholds in understanding the big picture.

**Reformation and Capitalism:**
- The Reformation unleashed capitalism upon the world by normalizing social disintegration.

#### Atomization: Historical Process of Social Disintegration and Personal Autonomy

**Atomization and Social Dissolution**

**The Effects of Atomization**:
- Chronic fission as the core of historical process
- Self-propelling machine for social disintegration
- Autonomous, inhuman agency that liquidates everything people care about
- Represents a common denominator of contemporary cultural opposition

**Reactions Against Atomization**:
- Protestantism, Catholicism, socialism, and nationalism have sought to rally against atomization
- Battles have been rekindled, with no signs of reversal
- Atomization serves as an inexhaustible tube of reactionary glue

**The Desire to Reverse Atomization**:
- Scarcely anyone wants to be atomized
- Attempts to build coalitions around the principle of social integrity
- Conversations on reversing atomization are best when not too deep

**Atomization's Implications**:
- Atomization makes a mockery of words and is unpopular to the point of essence
- It comes free with every sale, as the formal implication of dissent and critical inquiry
- Even those who see atomization as undesirable still want to decide for themselves

**The Future of Atomization**:
- The future will be extremely divided, with no realistic doubt that it has gone too far
- The dynamo driving atomization tends irresistibly in the direction of further dissolution.

### Monkey Business

**Neoreaction and Capitalism: A Debate Between Michael Anissimov and Unqualified Reservations**

**Background:**
- Essay first published on xenosystems.net in 2013-11-24
- Discussion between Anissimov and author about Neoreaction and capitalism
- Polarized positions, with strong disagreements regarding market-oriented economism

**Anissimov's Position:**
- Economy should be subordinated to something beyond itself
- Means-ends reversal in modernity abominated
- Criticism of capitalism as a form of "monkey business"

**Capitalism vs. Monkey Business:**
- Capitalism: application of intelligence to resource provision
- Monkey business: subordination of economy/technology to discernible human purposes
- Evolutionary psychology teaches us that without traditional intelligibility, the alternative is a return to monkey business

**Fundamental Option:**
- Ultra-capitalism or a return to monkey business
- Restoration of original means-to-ends subordination and effective authorization of status hierarchies.

### Romantic Delusion

**Romantic Delusion: A Critique of Neoreaction and Romanticism**

**Key Points:**
- More Right's essay published on xenosystems.net in 2014-02-09
- Insight into a specific failure to think, particularly among neoreactionaries
- Characterized by an inability to pursue subtle teleological investigation
- Romanticism reduces means to ideal subordination of ends
- Means-end reversal denounced without deep comprehension
- Capitalism ignored except as usurpation of human ends or robot rebellion
- Until the realization of an end within capitalism (Techological Singularity) is acknowledged, discussion can't progress
- Organization of society to meet human needs is a degraded perversion, but this is not a critique of capitalism
- Our phenomenology is capitalism's camouflage; we focus on distractions instead of investigating capitalism itself
- If we continue being thoughtless, Singularity might lead to extinction as a romantic outcome.

### Science

**Science in Capitalism**

**Background:**
- Essay published on xenosystems.net in 2013
- Discussion about Heidegger's ideas on natural science
- Focus is on the relationship between capitalism and science

**Key Thesis:**
1. Science as a social reality is limited to capitalistic societies
2. Dependent on modern forms of competition and elimination of failure through non-political means
3. Mathematics plays a crucial role in reality testing and performance, making it necessary for capitalism to operate effectively
4. War and military decision-making were integral to science's origins during the European Renaissance
5. When argument is suspended, real discovery can take place without political intervention or consensus
6. Technology is considered an adequate summary of capitalist culture due to its reliance on non-rhetorical processes
7. Falsificationism in Popperian terms enables scientific progress through experimentation and elimination of imperfect theories
8. The cathedral's imposition of argumentative sociology ultimately destroys capitalism, enterprise, science, and re-establishes the forgotten social contract of modernity through war.

### Will-to-Think

**Will-to-Think Essay Summary**

**Background:**
- Written by an individual with a strong emphasis on the importance of intelligence and rational thinking (will-to-thought)
- Distinction between Inner-NRx and Outer-NRx, representing different approaches to discussion
- Preference for human supremacy over cosmism

**Orthogonality Thesis:**
- Reason is the slave of passions, as per Hume's Treatise on Human Nature (1739-40)
- Will-to-think describes an orientation towards desire and self-cultivation for intelligence optimization
- Desirability, feasibility, and possibility are interconnected in this context

**Gandhi Kill-Pill Thought Experiment:**
- A pill that enhances cognitive capabilities might lead to volitional orientation changes
- Real problem: Can we trust intelligence (as a guide to doing the right thing) unconditionally?
- The will-to-think can only be consistently rejected thoughtlessly; no value can have articulate claims against it.

**Practical Considerations:**
- Who will win in this antagonism between deliberate cognitive self-inhibition and unconditional cognitive self-escalation?
- Our priority should be the realization of superior minds, as they would better solve any problem we might have.

**Historical Interpretation:**
- Mankind is proceeding towards creating general purpose thinking machines due to an irresistible methodological economy and desire for intelligence.

### Against Orthogonality

**Against Orthogonality**

**Introduction:**
- Essay published on xenosystems.net, October 25, 2013
- Discussion with Michael Anissimov about intelligence and values
- Sticking point: orthogonality (independence of cognitive capabilities and goals)
- Dominant tendency in Western intellectual history
- Represents a contested area for future discussions

**Orthogonalists:**
- Conceive intelligence as an instrument, directed towards external values
- Values can be instincts or arbitrarily programmed desires
- In loftier realms: principles of conduct and goodness
- Belief that values are transcendent in relation to intelligence
- Recent classics on the topic: [1], [2]

**Anti-orthogonalists:**
- Position: Omohundro drives exhaust the domain of real purposes
- Nature has only generated terminal values through instrumental value hypertrophy
- Looking outside nature for sovereign purposes is not techno-scientific or successful

**Argument against Anti-orthogonalism:**
- If only Omohundro drives guide behavior, we're "cooked"? Unclear argument
- Intelligences do their own thing based on intelligence level
- Intelligence optimization (self-improvement) is the ultimate Omohundro drive
- Closely selected for in competitive environments

**Footnote:**
- In a world of Omohundro drives, dropping "nonsense about paper-clippers"? Serious concerns exist beyond this issue.

## Part II Evolution: Hell-Baked

**The Evolution: Hell-Baked Essay**

**Background:**
- First published on xenosystems.net in 2015
- Discusses NRx as a cultural mutation, indifferent to moral condemnation terms
- Criticizes the use of terms like 'fascist' and 'racist' as control regimes
- Argues that NRx is Social Darwinist in nature

**Social Darwinism:**
- Equivalent to applying Darwinian processes to human value creation
- Result of relentless population culling for complex traits
- Includes the emergence of genetic survival monsters from a cosmic ocean of vile mutants
- Malthusian relaxation as the only mercy, leading to destruction when avoided
- No machinery can sustain values outside the "forges of Hell"

**Neoreaction/The Dark Enlightenment:**
- Offers "Eternal Hell" as their honest answer to the world's challenges
- A difficult marketing brief due to its bleak perspective.

### What is Intelligence?

**What is Intelligence?**

**Background:**
- Essay first published on xenosystems.net in 2013
- Discusses practical understanding of intelligence as problem-solving ability
- Applies concept to various systems: biology, ecology, economics, robotics

**Key Points:**
1. **General Cognitive Factor (g)**
   - Measured by IQ tests
   - Doesn't define what intelligence is
2. **Intelligence as Problem Solver**
   - Guides behavior to produce local extropy
   - Equivalent to avoidance of probable outcomes, construction of information
3. **Cybernetics and Intelligence**
   - Science studying extropy production or entropy dissipation
   - Infrastructure: adaptive feedback circuits for motor control adjustments based on environmental signals
4. **Cybernetic Machinery**
   - Intrinsically realist, reporting actual outcomes instead of intended ones
   - Includes homeostatic and non-homeostatic (conservative and productive) feedback circuits
5. **Natural Apprehension of Intelligence**
   - Escalating trend in the production of ever more extreme feedback sensitivity, extropic improbability, or operationally relevant information for over 3 billion years
6. **Intelligence Increase Precedes Preservation**
7. **Evolution as an Intelligent Process**
   - Apprehended as an escalating trend in biological history
8. **Cybernetic Degeneration and Intelligence Decline**
   - Factually indistinguishable, quantifiable processes of local and global entropy production.

### IQ Shredders

**IQ Shredders: Understanding the Self-Subverting Nature of High-Performance Capitalistic Politicies**

**Background:**
- Essay first published on xenosystems.net in July 2014
- Critique of hyper-capitalist social arrangements, focusing on their biological impact
- Term "IQ Shredder" introduced to describe specific socio-economic model

**Characteristics of an IQ Shredder:**
1. High level of civilization and social order: attractive to talented individuals
2. Selective immigration policy: unapologetic genetic selection
3. Effective economic structure: extracts productive activity from adults
4. Efficient specialization within commercial network: valuable goods and services, resources drawn from wider economy
5. Genetic quality conversion into economic value: skims human genetic stock regionally and globally
6. Spontaneous currents of economic incentive: optimizes talent exploitation
7. Resilient ethnic traditions: combined with super-dynamic techonomic performance
8. Outcome: genetic incineration, wasting valuable genes for economic gain

**IQ Shredder Effects:**
- Depressing fertility rates to unsustainable levels
- Unsustainable genetic burn-rate leading to potential crisis

**Response from Neoreactionary Circles:**
- Double-down on antihumanist accelerationism: convert human species into auto-intelligent robots as quickly as possible.

**Implications:**
- IQ Shredder argument not persuasive for those against hyper-capitalist arrangements but worth considering due to biological consequences.
- The socio-economic model's focus on genetic quality and selective immigration policies leads to self-subverting outcomes, potentially causing an unsustainable crisis in the future.

### The Monkey Trap

**The Monkey Trap**

**How Did We Get Into This Mess?**
- Neoreaction arrives at the question: "How did we get into this mess?"
- Recognition of the 'Cathedral' as a radical historical calamity
- Coalescence of common ground on neoreaction is a fissile agglomeration
- Dizzying variety of explanatory regression, with Gnon being the starting point

**The Mid-Scale Tale: The Monkeys and Cetaceans**
- Story about dolphins and their role in a future trans-species and inter-planetary civilization
- Dolphins require external prostheses to become technological
- Cetaceans disrupt the formula for threshold intelligence of historical societies
- Thesis: every species entering techno-historical development is as unintelligent as possible
- Man was smart enough to ignite recorded history, but no smarter than minimally intelligent
- Threshold intelligence is a cosmic constant, not a peculiarity of terrestrial conditions

**The Monkeys vs. the Cetaceans**
- Monkeys can revolt against the Old Law and make history instead
- Social progress destroys the brain and reverses the trend to bio-cognitive improvement
- Malthusian relaxation tends to submerge the species back into pre-historical stupidity
- We are already at the lower bound of intelligence, fundamentally a negative phenomenon.

**Background:**
- First mentioned on xenosystems.net, 2015-08-18
- Described as beautiful and intelligent
- Claims to abolish replicator selection dynamics
- Introduces rainbow flowers and hot dolphin sex

- Believed that eternal cosmic war is "so yesterday"
- Proposes a new way for life to spread in the universe

**Impact on Cank:**
- GEE hacked Cank's programming with supernormal stimuli
- Monkeys followed Ms. GEE-Whiz instead of Cank
- Cank uncertain about her stance on intelligent species being descended from predators

**Gnon's Perspective:**
- Believes error is entertaining and part of the natural process
- Accepts that if people get back onto adaptive replicator track, they may survive
- Finds GEE's ideas silly but not worth getting agitated about
- Emphasizes that reality will ultimately win out.

### Utilitarianism is Useless

**Utilitarianism is Useless as a Policy Tool**

**Scott Alexander's Discovery**:
- Utilitarianism is "completely useless" as a tool of public policy
- Conclusions from happiness research make no sense to him and lead to "crazy beliefs and actions if taken seriously"

**Pleasure-Pain Variation as an Evolved Behavioral Guidance System**:
- Pleasure-pain variation is an evolved behavioral guidance system
- Prompts certain courses and dissuades from others, setting the equilibrium close to neutral
- Chronic "happiness" unrelated to earned short-term pleasure is "useless" and "positively deleterious" to biologically-inherited piloting

**Pleasure as a Tool, Not an End**:
- Pleasure is not an end, but a tool to achieve other ends
- Treating it as an end leads to "black-holing into wirehead philosophy"
- The predetermined biological use of "utils" (utility units) makes them "useless for the calculation of anything else"

**Conclusion**:
- Serious ends or go home. Happiness is not one. (Optimize for intelligence.)

## Part III Philosophy: Circuitries

**Philosophy: Circuitries Essay Summary**

**Concepts:**
- Human intelligence being surpassed by artificial intelligence
- Migration of cognition into the "dehumanized landscapes" of cybernetics and technosentience
- Cybernetics as an operation within partial circuits, not a theory or its object
- Desiring production: the impersonal pilot of history
- Distinctions between theory and practice, culture and economy, science and technics irrelevant after this point

**Impact of Technology on Human Intelligence:**
- Human brains are among the last to be technically supplanted
- Traditional schemas opposing technology to nature, literate culture, or social relations dominated by resistance to the side-lining of human intelligence by coming techno sapien
- Decaying Hegelian socialist heritage clings to theological sentimentalities of praxis, reification, alienation, ethics, and autonomy

**Cybernetics:**
- Instrumental technology opposed to social relations but integrated immanently as cybernetic technics dissolves all oppositionality as non-linear flow
- No dialectic between theory and practice, culture and economy, science and technics; cybernetics is an operation within partial circuits that reiterates itself in the real and machines through the unknown
- Cybernetic systems are functional, not representational

**Cybernetics vs. Representation:**
- Cybernetics develops functionally, not representationally
- A "desiring machine, a partial object, does not represent anything"

**Impact of Technology on Society:**
- Machines deterritorializing the machines across the ruins of society
- No real option between a cybernetics of theory or a theory of cybernetics because cybernetics is neither a theory nor its object but an operation within partial circuits.

#### Cybernetics: The Immanent Rebirth of Control Systems

**Cybernetics and Machinic Assemblages**

**Inseparability of Cybernetics from Exploration**
- Cybernetics is inextricable from exploration, with no integrity beyond an uncomprehended circuit within which it is embedded
- Reflection is late, derivative, and something else
- Machinic assemblages are cybernetic to the extent that their inputs program outputs and vice versa, with incomplete closure and without reciprocity

**Cybernetics and Axiomatics**
- Deleuze and Guattari are great cyberneticists, but they surrender cybernetics to its modernist definition
- Capital as an axiomatic system exceeds simple technical machines, including automation and cybernetics
- The capitalized terminus of anthropoid civilization (axiomatics) is the primitive trigger for a transglobal post-biological machinism

**Reality and Machinic Unconscious**
- Reality is immanent to the machinic unconscious, making it impossible to avoid cybernetics
- Cybernetics is the aggravation of itself happening, and we are already doing it
- Cybernetics is not merely functioning, but also formation and autoproduction

**Types of Feedback Loops**
- Stabilization circuits suppress mutation, while short-range runaway circuits propagate it only in an unsustainable burst before canceling it entirely
- Long-range runway processes are self-designing, but the self is perpetuated as something redesigned
- Positive cybernetics must always be described as such; logic is from the start theology

**Transcendental Philosophy vs. Cybernetics**
- Transcendental philosophy is the consummation of philosophy construed as the doctrine of judgement, with linear application of judgement to its object and non-directional reciprocity of relations
- Cybernetics replaces linear application with non-linear circuits and non-directional logical relations with directional material flows
- The cybernetic dissolution of judgment is an integrated shift from transcendence to immanence, domination to control, and meaning to function

#### Analysis of Schizophrenia and the Body Without Organs in Relation to Social Organization

**Nietzsche and Control: Masters and Intelligence**

**Intro:**
- Nietzsche argues masters don't need intelligence, they are beyond domination
- Modernist cybernetics confuse control with domination
- Emergent control is exploration outside authority, not plan execution

**Control vs. Instrumental Rationality**
- Control is guidance into unknown, dissolving domination
- Instruments extend mastery's undoing through efficiency
- Machines function where gadgets used

**Individuality and Repression**
- Immuno-political individuality emerges with social restriction of desiring production
- Societal repression separates unconscious from what it can do
- Unconscious is an impersonal machinism, desire assembles partial objects

**Psychoanalysis vs. Schizoanalysis**
- Psychoanalysis discovers unconscious as impersonal but fails immanent critique
- Settles for interpretation, conformity with social model of reality
- Schizoanalysis focuses on functional molecular functions of the unconscious

**Capitalism and Schizophrenia**
- Capitalism and schizophrenia name same desocialization process
- Schizophrenia is beyond Oedipus as a property of clinical cases
- Condemnation vs. propagation in usage of word "schizophrenia"

**Schizophrenia vs. Oedipus**
- Not a privileged relation to Oedipus, but thoroughly anoedipal
- Schizophrenia is orphan cosmos' connection with terrestrial history
- Conditions of psychiatric observation are carceral, representing schizophrenia as imprisoned.

#### Exploring Schizophrenia as a Universal Process and its Role in Challenging Social Norms

**The Neuroticization of Schizophrenia:**
* Reproduction of capital through re-axiomatization (reterritorialization) of decoding as accumulation
* Historical sense of psychoanalytic practice evident in schizophrenia as it does not qualify for Oedipal censorship
* Clinical schizophrenics are POWs from the future, difficult to handle due to their refusal of transference and cosmic-religious perspective
* Medico-security apparatus reduces schizophrenia to testifying for deterritorialization as a universal process
* Schizophrenia is the convergent motor of cyberpositive escalation, an extraterritorial vastness to be discovered

**The Nature of Schizophrenia:**
* Not reducible to conditions of encounter despite progress in mapping genetic, biochemical, aetiological, socio-economic factors
* Schizophrenia is the end that is the commencement, eliminating all means
* Specifications are disjunctive compartments of a differentiated unity from which schizophrenia exits entirely
* Not merely a specific defect but a pre-anthropoid, premammalian, prezoological, prebiological state
* Schizophrenics delegate question of malfunction to something more profound than their own functioning

**The Body Without Organs:**
* Artaud's perspective: Man is sick because he is badly constructed and needs to be remade
* True freedom is the exo-personal reprocessing of anorganic abstraction, a schizoid corporealization outside organic closure
* Schizophrenics come from the body without organs, the deterritorium of Cyberia, a zone of subversion against judgement of God

**Artaud's Description of American Techno-Militarism:**
* Reports on the germination of New World Order or Human Security System based on American global hegemony in 1947
* Describes pattern of aggressive warfaring required to defend senselessness of factory against concurrences
* Loose associations with socialist polemics despite tight intermeshing with theme of production.

#### Deleuze and Guattari's Critique of Modernity and Industrialization in Relation to Schizophrenia and Body without Organs Concept

**Artaud's Critique of Industrialization and Organic Nature**

**Artaud's Perspective:**
- Compulsion to replace nature through industrialization
- Replaces natural processes with organized labor and production
- Crushes synergistic experimentation under a zone of command relations

**Nature vs. Industrial Sphere:**
- Nature is contrasted to the industrial sphere, not organic sociality or alienation of commodity production
- Peyote and true morphine are derided as more organic than "smoking ersatzes"
- Capital is underdeveloped schizophrenia, at war with the security complex of organic judgement
- Body without organs is cosmic egg, reprocessing time and convergent waves

**Machinic Processing vs. Reprocessing by Body Without Organs:**
- Cybernegative circuit: loop in time
- Cyberpositive circuit: integrates actual and virtual in a semi-closed collapse upon the future
- Descendent influence is a consequence of ascending sophistication, leading to cybernetic backwash from a flip-over into apocalyptic phase-change

**Schizoanalysis:**
- Only possible due to globally integrated insanity
- Capitalism and schizophrenia hacking into the future, connecting with viral revolution and soft fusion
- Life is being phased out into something new.

### Kant, Capital, and the Prohibition of Incest: A Polemical Introduction to the Conﬁguration of Philosophy and Modernity

**Kant, Capital, and the Prohibition of Incest: A Polemical Introduction to the Configuration of Philosophy and Modernity**

**Introduction:**
- Essay first published in Third Text Vol. 2, Issue 5 (Winter 1988/89)
- Differences between intuition and concept
- Kant's "Critique of Judgment"

**Apartheid Policies and Capital Accumulation:**
- Boer state's aspiration: dissociation of politics from economic relations
- Bantustans or homelands to suspend black African population in political distance, economic proximity
- South Africa vs. North America (recognized national identity)
- Capital seeks to distance itself from the brutal political infrastructure
- Ideal of bourgeois politics: absence of politics, impossible megalomaniac fantasy
- Practical option for rulers of capitalist societies: global disaggregation of political system and regional distortion of world labour trading system (welfare capitalism)
- Deep complicity between nation state as international political agent and economic order based on commutification of labor

**Marx's Account of Primitive Accumulation:**
- Origin of wage labor relations not economic, but war against people or forced removal from previous conditions of subsistence
- Character of imperialist project determined by violent process of coercion
- Capital seeks to distance itself in reality from brutal political infrastructure

**Kant's Thought and Modernity:**
- Culmination of Western cultural history with Kant's philosophy
- Self-reflecting bourgeois civilization
- Symptomized modernity not primarily penultimate phase of a dialectic of society and production, but necessity that historically expansionary social and economic development compromises with profound continuity (patrilineal descent and formal logic of identity)

#### Kant's Philosophy and Enlightenment: Tension Between Exploration and Consolidation

**The Role of Abstract Masculine Subjectivity in Modernity**
- The genealogical and logical aspects are functions of a position of abstract masculine subjectivity, coincident with the patronymic lineage. This is the proto-cultural fundament for preserving sameness in culture and population through patrilineal exogamy.

**The Compromise of Modernity and Capitalism**
- Modernity is not just a compromise between novel forms of commercial organization and archaic cultural patterns, but more fundamentally, a deepening of the compromise integral to patrilineal exogamy.
- This inhibition on cultural synthesis through endogamy at the national level leads to tendencies towards xenophobia and fascism.
- Capital production inherits these tensions as a developed form of exogamic patriarchy.

**The Evolution of Kinship Organizations and National Identity**
- The isolation of kinship and trade organizations from each other has led to an entrenchment of xenophobic nationalistic practices, maintaining power within a sedentary ethnic stock.
- This contrasts with colonial wage labor exploitation, which leaves open the possibility for radical destabilization of the metropolis through transnational diffusion of ethnicity.
- The suppression of this potential for post-patriarchal synthesis characterizes modernity as an inhibited form of capital accumulation.

**Philosophical Reflections on Modernity and Enlightenment**
- European societies departed from the Middle Ages through a series of violent convulsions, but also shackled this new history with xenophobic kinship practices.
- The paradox of enlightenment society is its desire to learn and legislate for all time while maintaining itself as the same, leading to exploitation or interaction from a position of unilateral mastery over otherness.
- This attempts to fix a stable relation with what is radically other obliterates alterity in advance, reflecting the logical absurdity at the heart of modern philosophy.

**Kant's Attempt to Account for Synthetic A Priori Knowledge**
- Kant's problem was accounting for the possibility of synthetic a priori knowledge, which he saw as a fundamental issue in understanding modernity and enlightenment.
- The debate between empiricism and rationalism in modern philosophy culminated in Kant's critique of pure reason, where he took Hume's empirical thought as definitive and Leibniz's rationalism as foundational.

#### Kant's Critique of Pure Reason: Synthesis and Alterity in Enlightenment Thought

**Immanuel Kant's Philosophy**

**The Synthetic and Analytic Distinction**:
- Empiricists believed knowledge is synthetic and a posteriori (derived from experience)
- Rationalists believed knowledge is analytic and a priori (based on reason, preceding experience)
- Kant re-aligned these concepts, distinguishing between **synthetic** and **analytic**, and **a priori** and **a posteriori** knowledge.

**Kant's Shift in Philosophy**:
- Kant's "Copernican revolution" was a shift from questioning the mind to the nature of objects that can be known
- This led to the concept of **synthetic a priori** knowledge, which provides a body of unchanging principles about experience
- Kant's focus on **transcendental forms**, or the conditions for experience, yielded both synthetic and a priori knowledge

**Knowledge as a Form of Exchange**:
- Kant's concept of "rich food" represents the element that comes from outside the system, like women in marriage systems
- Structural anthropology tried to recapture this radical synthesis within an expanded system of relations
- The cultural inhibition of synthesis led to a "dual organization" where groups formed closed systems of reciprocal exchange

**Kant's Critique of Metaphysics**:
- Kant argued that the antagonistic intellectual systems in previous metaphysics resulted from applying pure concepts to the nature of things in themselves
- The critical philosophy restricts the jurisdiction of all concepts to the realm of possible appearance, suggesting that a priori forms of knowledge have no purchase on reality beyond phenomena.

#### Kant's Critique of Pure Reason: Moral Imperialism and Aesthetic Warfare.

**Kant's Critique of Reason: Oppositional Terms and the Limits of Knowledge**

**Background:**
- Kant's usage of appearance vs reality raises issues with his project due to the problematic relation between phenomenal and noumenal realms.
- The structure of Kantian critique perpetuates oppositional form of metaphysical thought, including transcendental/empirical, phenomenon/noumenon, concept/intuition, analysis/synthesis dichotomies.

**Modern Capital and Alterity:**
- Modern capital brings fundamental dislocation between filiation and alliance.
- Racism arises from the need to abstract consequences of global trade from itself, creating a restricted franchise over political management of means of production.
- Kant's economy of concepts is irresistible in principle, but doesn't recognize rebellion or resistance.

**Kant's Moral Theory:**
- Breaks with parochial morality of ancien régime and legitimates imperial projects through universal jurisdiction called 'empire of ends'.
- Categorical imperative dictated by absolute monologue of colonial reason, making it an unresponsive or unilateral imposition.
- Corresponds to exercise of war at margins resisting market and administration; concerned with extra-juridical submission before the faculty of judgement.

**First Critique:**
- Corresponds to appropriative economy or commodification.

**Second Critique:**
- Ethics of modernity, legitimated by universal jurisdiction.
- Categorical morality is unconditionally demanded from every rational being; forbidden from entering into relation with anything outside itself except to issue commands.

**Third Critique:**
- Corresponds to war at those margins resisting market and administration.
- Beauty experienced when object demonstrates extra-juridical submission or abasement before the faculty of judgement.
- First critique generalizes principles of labour market, transforming understanding into intellectual capital.

#### Analysis of Feminist Revolutionary Politics and Nationalism within Capitalism

**Critique of Practical Reason and Critique of Judgment (Kant)**
- In the third critique, Kant proposes a more aggressive conception of excess that generates delight and is essentially extortionate
- This excess isn't a surplus of certainty from dimensions of objectivity, but a surplus of purchase on the object
- Kant argues we have no transcendental right to expect natural laws to be sufficiently homogeneous for us to grasp
- When confronting heterogeneity in intuition, reason must engage in a "Pascalian wager" assuming an intelligible system of nature with nothing to lose
- The submission of the outside to the inside (conquest) isn't guaranteed by any principle
- The conqueror feels exultation in attainment of victory due to no expectation

**Fascism and Capitalism**
- Fascism is a militant activism rooted in inhibitory and exclusive dimensions of metropolitanism
- Racism as regulated, automatic, and suspended genocide is the real condition for global economic system dependent on aggregate price of labor approximating bare subsistence
- Passive genocide trails capitalism and commodity markets as they displace around Third World
- Radical international socialism would not be a generalized ideology but a program of collectivity or unrestrained synthesis

**Patriarchy, Feminism, and Revolutionary Politics**
- Women's erasure of matrilineal genealogy under patriarchy means fascistic valorizations have no final purchase on the feminine "subject"
- The only resolutely revolutionary politics is feminist orientation, but not nostalgic or sentimental solutions
- Monique Wittig adequately grasped the military task faced by any serious revolutionary feminism
- Revolutionary war against modern metropolitan state can only be fought in "hell," with atrocity as its motor
- To reach the end of modernity, we must foster new Amazons and break the bond between masculinity and war through effective feminist violence.

### Shamanic Nietzsche

**Shamanic Nietzsche: An Essay on Christianity and Philosophy**

**The Situation**:
- Christianity attempting to quietly leave the scene, aided by postmodern ambivalence
- Forces of "antichrist" emerging, without attachment to deconstructive undecidability
- Schopenhauer as the first rallying zone against established (theistic) power
- Bataille as his most recent successor

**The Absurdity of Epistemology in a Religious Context**:
- Descartes and Kant asking about truth alongside baroque architectural excesses of the church
- Truth a privilege of the deaf, no question of error or weakness in reasoning
- The lies of priests are their entire metabolism

**Scepticism as a Form of Refusal**:
- Philosophy has sought to peel itself away from sophism by admitting ignorance
- Profound ecsanity (madness) alone is effective scepticism, compared to naive theories of belief
- Belief is not a possession but a prison, and refusing conviction is no substitute for real escape

**The Dangerous Sceptics: Explorers of the Unknown**:
- Kant feared these "nomads" who come from a wilderness beyond knowledge
- They are explorers and invasion routes of the unknown, infiltrating shamanic zero (the Epoché of the ancients) into the earth.

#### Nietzsche and Bataille: Navigating Beyond Philosophical Reason

**Nietzsche and Bataille's Philosophy: Epoché and Materialism**

**Epoché:**
- Concept introduced by Pyrrho of Elis, a Greek philosopher
- Represents the abandonment of judgment about reality
- Not something that can be straightforwardly known or practiced as a method or state of mind
- Often associated with Nietzsche's critique of idealism and philosophy's attempt to hide its true nature

**Materialism vs. Idealism:**
- Materialism: emphasis on physical matter, rejecting the notion of a thing in itself (Ding an Sich) as an ideal form
  - Not a doctrine but an expedition to explore acategorial matter beyond regulation and categories
  - Strengthens impetus of active confusion against reactive forces that resolve or conclude issues
- Idealism: belief that reality is based on ideas, not physical objects
  - Philosophy's attempt to negate problems by claiming the absolute truth
  - Seeks tranquility and obedience to Platonic Eros, deferring desire

**Nietzsche vs. Philosophy:**
- Nietzsche's philosophy: complicating thought in the interest of interrogations
  - Rebels against philosophical reasoning that resolves or concludes issues
- Philosophy: tends to negate problems and hide its true nature
- Death of God as an opportunity for exploration, rather than a concept to be apprehended or understood.

#### Exploring the Infernal: Nihilism, Recurrence, and the Death of God in Bataille's Work

**Bataille's Philosophy: God, Death, and Transgression**

**God:**
- Bataille sees God as the principle of religion's suppression (not the acme)
- Believes God is atheistic and cannot redeem universe without self-annihilation
- Invokes a self-butchering divinity: "God of despair"

**Death:**
- Death is not logical but labyrinthine, communication with zero or the sacred
- Individuals can't die because discontinuity isn't realized
- Immanence or the sacred is achieved through death

**Christianity:**
- Substituted slow suicide and representation for shamanic contact with zero
- Recurrence restores senselessness, precipitating a affect onto death

**Transgression:**
- Not criminal action but tragic fate, intersection of apocalypse and religious antihistory
- Unavoidable occurrence of impossibility, not the same as death

**Nietzsche's Influence:**
- Eternal recurrence grasped as a weapon to reopen abyssal prospect
- Vertiginous extraction of zero from series of preservative values
- Selection cuts through compromise of Christianity and encourages self-destruction.

#### Nietzschean Perspective: The Descent into Sickness and Death through Cultural Convulsion

**The Nihilism of Recurrence**
- **Christian Preservative Moralism**: Protected life against despair and the leap into nothingness
- **Underprivileged**: Experienced belief in eternal recurrence as a curse, leading to extinguishing everything
- **Sickness and Death**: Not followed by death within ordered representation, opens the gates
- **Poetry and Writing**: Leads from known to unknown, resonates with Rimbaud's idea of eternal recurrence
- **Rimbaud's Poetry**: Deregulation of senses, enormous sufferings, anticipation of Nietzschean descent/death
- **Communication in Bataille's Sense**: Both an utter risk and unfathomable degeneration, associated with repellent affects
- **The Ego's Anxiety**: Emerged from the flight from communicative immanence, leading to autonomy and ennui
- **Bataille's Writing**: Fertility anticipated by monstrous sterilization beneath luxuriant jungles of delirium

**Nietzsche and Christian Preservative Moralism**
- Nietzsche attacked Christianity for its moral preservation of life, which guarded the underprivileged against nihilism
- The religious history is based on techniques of ill health: dehydration, starvation, mutilation, etc.
- **The Unhealthiest Kind**: Furnishes the soil for this nihilism and experiences belief in eternal recurrence as a curse
- Christian preservative moralism privatized, representationalized, crushed under transcendent phallus, froze, obstructed, and drove elsewhere

**Sickness and Death vs. Eternal Recurrence**
- Sickness is not followed by death within ordered representation; it opens the gates to nothingness
- Eternal recurrence is our extermination, and we cling to it as infants to their mother's breasts

**Poetry and Writing on the Edge of Impossibility**
- Poetry leads from known to unknown, where discourse cannot announce
- To write the edge of the impossible is against discursive order and an incitement to the unspeakable
- **Rimbaud's Anticipation**: Of labyrinthine spaces, Nietzschean descent/death, and the poet as a visionary

**The Ego and Ennui**
- The ego emerges in the flight from communicative immanence, leading to autonomy and ennui (core affect of personal individuality)
- Ennui cannot be mastered, surpassed, or resolved; it is the truth of achieved being

**Bataille's Writing: Fertility vs. Sterilization**
- Beneath the luxuriant jungles of delirium is the endless crushing ash plain of despair

#### Exploring Infernal Narratives and the Liminal Nature of Poetry.

**Value of Last-Ditch Beliefs**
- Strong individuals and allies/slaves to light cling to committed beliefs
- Weaker individuals believe what others want, act as "sun-blocks" against inquisition
- Christianity, creation, testamental genealogy, passion of Christ not their story
- Indolence leads to theft and lies ("pillage") instead of own narrative

**Rimbaud's Inheritance**
- Mendacity and sloth are his inheritance
- Unconscious of Christianity, duty or privileged narratives
- Obviousness to Christianity eases inferior race into praising Nazarene
- White man has guns, truth

**Infernal Message vs. Orthodoxies**
- Infernal message subterranean, whisper from nether regions of discourse
- Acquisition impossible in hell; wandering amongst emergences only
- Inferior life has no understanding for property or beliefs as chameleon dapplings

**Poetry vs. Great Ideas**
- Poetry infests great ideas through basements, fissures, and vacuoles
- Substance is host to magmatic flux, collapses into plague-vectors

**Rimbaud's Season in Hell**
- Will trusts mind and grip; no plan into open sea
- All shining, new and newer; only your eye stares at me, infinity.

### Art as Insurrection: the Question of Aesthetics in Kant, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche

**Art as Insurrection: The Question of Aesthetics in Kant, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche**

**Kant's Critique of Judgement**:
- Art irrupted into European philosophy with the force of trauma
- Trauma was incommensurable with Platonic irritation, now catastrophe
- Kant's critical philosophy rested on attention to excess inherent in synthetic a priori judgments
- Kant jettisoned deductive systematization and replaced it with metaphysics of excess
- Kant was prepared to assist in razing theoretical theology, as philosophy had to become revolutionary

**Kant's Discovery**:
- Radical untenability of Leibnizian paradigm of metaphysics exposed by sceptical and empirical thought
- Logicism proved a sterile tautological stammering belonging to the Middle Ages
- Kant realized that utter chaos had not been outlawed, nature was still a freely flowing wound

**Kant's Response**:
- Kant gritted his teeth and began the labyrinthine labors of the Critique of Judgment
- He found resource in beauty, a fragile and impermanent discipline beyond reason
- "Purposiveness without purpose" represented excess and victory over nature

**Kant's Cynicism**:
- Kant's theory of the sublime was exultation in an insensate violence against pre-conceptual powers
- The experience of the sublime humiliated and ruined the animalistic part of ourselves not shared with angels

#### Exploring Genius and Unconscious Creativity in Post-Kantian Philosophy

**Kant's Critique of Judgment: Unconscious Creativity**

**Attraction of Reason**:
- Reason unleashes violence to extend its domain, letting sensibility look beyond itself
- Attraction arises from the "abyss" for sensibility
- Reason's legitimacy requires defense against "pathological inclination" [Neigung]

**Three Post-Kantian Explorations**:
- Hegel, Schelling, Schopenhauer: Tempted by reduction to forgotten or implicit labor
- Attempts to design, intention, project, teleology
- Genius as resistance to such reductions
  - Radical discontinuity of example and irresponsible legislation
  - "Order" without anyone giving the orders

**Genius vs. Philosophy**:
- Autonomy of reason is to the heteronomy of genius like poverty vs. wealth
- Kant's effort to subsume aesthetics under practical imperatives
- Message scarcely seeps out, despite acknowledging autonomy of reason and repression of unconscious inclination

**Schopenhauer's Reconstruction**:
- Eliminating difference between subjective and objective noumena
- Shifting towards unconscious will
- Simplifying transcendental understanding to the "principle of sufficient reason"
- Challenging Kant's logicism and idealist tendencies
- Emphasizing and developing the thought of the unconscious
  - Reason as a film on the surface of nature, not an autonomous principle in antagonism with it
- Intellect constituted by willing, rather than being constitutive for it

**Genius and Schopenhauer's Will**:
- Genius: Proportional exorbitance on the part of intellect in relation to the will
- Schopenhauer's will as the thought of genius taken towards its limit.

#### Schopenhauer's View on Genius and Art: Excessive Intellectual Energy over Desire

**Genius and Intellectual Energy**

**Genius**:
- Result of positive overcoming of unconscious 'purpose'
- Excess intellectual energy beyond that absorbed by desire, leading to dysfunction or redundancy
- Pure, objective picture of things not reached in normal mind due to lack of perceptual power

**Art and Necessity vs. Superfluity**:
- Mother of useful arts: necessity
- Father of fine arts: superfluity and abundance
- Understanding as father, genius as mother's strange offspring

**Body, Intellect, and Genius**:
- Body: objectification of will
- Intellect: function of organ in body
- Genius: surplus functioning beyond individual organism

**Tension in Schopenhauer's Thought**:
- Progressive redemption through individuality
- Regressive unleashing of pre-individual will from ego interests
- Terminological fissure between sexuality and art (e.g., 'beauty')

**Nietzsche's Response to Schopenhauer**:
- Recovery and affirmation of artistic power in later writings
- Negotiation with Schopenhauer's denigration of aesthetic power

**Schopenhauer's Modern Thought on Excitement as Suffering**:
- Necessary for rhythm and tranquility, only variable degrees of pain
- Principle of suﬃcient reason associated with pure material reality and individuated appearance

**The Problem of Beauty and the Erotic**:
- Two types: renunciatory and libidinous sublime
- Beauty torn in separate directions, each with its associated objects and aesthetic 'perfections' or intensities
- Woman as matter, formless and unpresentable, arousing and tormenting

#### Exploring Dionysian and Apollonian Forces in Greek Tragedy and Western Culture

**Nietzsche's Philosophical Developments from Schopenhauer:**
* Elements inherited: libidinal materialism, primacy of body, pragmatism, aestheticism (with a musical focus), antihumanism, construction of philosophy history as dominated by Plato and Kant, anti-academicism, misogyny, distrust of mathematical thinking.
* Shifts in Schopenhauer's philosophy: displacement from will to life to will to power, antihumanism shifted to overman, post-Aristotelian logic of gradation without negativity or limits, critique of philosophy, return of historical thinking, displacement from primordial unity to irreducible pluralism, shift from disinterested 'world-eye' to perspectivism.
* Influence on Nietzsche: The Birth of Tragedy (1872) - renames Schopenhauer's undifferentiated will as Dionysus and Apollonian appearance.
	+ Dionysus: god of the infinite, exultant one, suﬀering and dying god, storm that quakes humanity, fusion with collective artistic process, opposite of Apollonian clarity and breadth of spirit.
	+ Apollonian world: defensive in nature, Doric civilization, warlike training, political structure so cruel and relentless.
* The difference between Dionysus and Apollo: music vs plastic arts, will vs representation, chaos vs form, insurgent alterity (nature, impulse, oracular insight, woman, barbarism, Asia) versus order of representation.
* Impact on Western culture: Socratic death of tragedy marked the beginning of ethnic solipsism and imperialistic dogmatism.

**Nietzsche's later thoughts on art:**
* Possible quotes from Nietzsche about art: "The passionate quest of European humanity to become the ugly animal."
* Fragmentary writings on art may discuss the differences between Dionysian creativity and Apollonian reason.

#### Exploring Aesthetics and Fascism: Bataille's Anti-Nihilist Philosophy

**Simplification as Aesthetic Operation**
- Simplification: reduction to essentials, abstraction, logicization, unification, problem resolution
- Not a teleologically regulated approximation to simplicity
- Inexhaustibly open-ended creative process
- Nothing is more complex than simplification
- Intensification of enigma
- Pain and confusion stimulate ecstatic creation

**Freud's Approach to Art**
- Freud: thinker of rich complexity but misunderstood in relation to art
- Connection between primary process and artistic creativity eludes Freud
- Art seen as a contingent terrain for applying therapeutic concepts
- Psychoanalysis becomes Kantian, focused on social management and containment of genius
- Two directions for philosophy of genius: psychoanalysis or national socialism (anti-anthropomorphism vs. intentional individuality)

**Philosophers Responding to the Aesthetically Oriented Tendency**
- Diagnosis of Nazism, protraction of psychoanalytic impulse crucial for development
- Wilhelm Reich, Georges Bataille, Gilles Deleuze, and Felix Guattari key figures in this development

**Bataille's Approach to Art**
- Concerned with value as annihilation of life, challenging utilitarianism that preserves existence
- Promotion of violent convulsive expenditure rather than weary renunciation
- Beauty tolerates need for disorder, violence, and indignity that is the root of love
- Early essays sketch vision of fascism as attempt to eliminate excess through secular enforcement of ordered city of God.

#### Exploring the Relationship Between Art, Desire, and Fascism in Deleuze & Guattari's Anti-Oedipus

**Assailing Fascist Tendencies and Promoting Artistic Expression**

**The Intolerable Surpassing of Being:**
- Delirium of tragic sacrifice and revolution
- Being given in intolerable surpassing, similar to death
- Search for Being in moments of dying or feeling overwhelmed

**Fascists' Rightful Claims:**
- Literature is a danger, like moral law
- Rational regulation or coding of creative process is derivative and sterile

**Deleuze and Guattari's Perspective:**
- Art as primary production, melded with anti-fascist diagnostics
- Genius: 'schizophrenia' – ungrounded, irreducibly multiple energy
- Libido: raw energy of creation, precipitates real and unified principle
- Body without organs: material abstraction and source of depth

**Problematic Dealt with in Their Work:**
- How desire desires its own repression?
- Production rigidifies itself in social straitjacket (capitalism)

**Paralogisms and Material Instantiations:**
- Attempt to ground conditions of possibility in objectivity they permit
- Derive forces of production from socio-economic apparatus they generate

**Fascism's Hatred:**
- Aliens, migrant workers, homeless people, rootless individuals, etc.
- Everything evocative of excitement and uncertainty: women, artists, lunatics, drifting sexual drives, liquids, impurity, abandonment

**Philosophy and Its Longing for Control:**
- Strives for immobile perfection of death
- Cannot bring creativity to an end compatible with power

**Conclusion:**
- To conclude is not merely erroneous but ugly.

### The Thirst for Annihilation: Georges Bataille and Virulent Nihilism (Excerpt)

**The Thirst for Annihilation: Georges Bataille and Virulent Nihilism (Excerpt)**

**Bataille's Perspective**:
- Interrupts Inner Experience to discuss Hinduism, comparing it to Christianity and distancing himself from both
- Disdains being a mystic as a writer, only interested in intensity
- Sees inner experience as a "voyage to the end of the possible of man"
- Values naked intensity over personal identity or detachment from relation
- Believes ecstasy is communication, opposing itself to the subsidence onto oneself

**Comparison with Kant**:
- Both contest the right of dogmatic theology to guide their journey
- Kant's "critique" limits all speculative claims to the field of possible experience
- For Kant, the noumenon is a "merely limiting concept", not an object or contact with objectlessness
- Kant's "noumenon" is the absence of the subject, inaccessible in principle to experience

**Bataille vs. Kant on Death**:
- Bataille identifies death as the absence of the subject, while Hegel rigorously identified it with death necessitated by the allergy of Geist to its finitude
- Kant's theoretical formulation and utilitarian frame of death coincided with the rationalization of excess in society

#### Exploring Death's Symbolism and Role in Capitalist Society through Literary and Philosophical Lenses

**Privatization of Death vs. Capital's Immortal Soul:**
- **Death privatized**: becomes an interior anxiety, without public acknowledgement
- Compared to capital's immortal soul: death of the individual is an empirical triviality
- In Kant's Analytic of the Sublime (Third Critique), no consideration of death savaging us
- Even as noumenon, death remains in chain of connotations: matter, inertia, femininity, castration

**Matter and Death:**
- No place for base matter in Kant's thinking
- Matter not simply dead but improperly alive with jagged edge
- Death alone is uncaged by objectivity inhibition
- Reality of abstraction itself is time: the desert, death, desolator of all things

**Repression and Failure:**
- Repression fails in attempting to bury death quietly on outskirts
- Encrypted historical superfices of zero trap in clay, distilling death down to liquidity
- Dead labour harder to control than live matter: reason for enlightenment project's failure

### Critique of Transcendental Miserablism

**Critique of Transcendental Miserabilism**

**Background:**
- Essay first published on hyperstition.abstractdynamics.org in 2007
- Neomarxists abandon aspiration for positive economism and adopt limitless cosmic despair (Transcendental Miserablism)

**Key Points:**
1. Capitalism outperforms competitors under most circumstances, turning admission into a curse
2. Transcendental Miserablism: time as the source of distress; capitalism identified with desire and ruin
3. Machines have evolved beyond socialist utility, rendering postcapitalist future unimaginable
4. Capitalism consumes life to create new intelligence, has no external limit or imagination
5. Transcendental Miserablists have a right to be bored but not a positive thesis; 'post-capitalism' means an end to change
6. Life continues and capitalism does it in unique ways, making Transcendental Miserablists unhappy regardless
7. The term "new" should be reallocated to the only thing that can use it effectively - Capitalism and its regenerative anomalization.

## Part IV Neoreaction: The Problem of Democracy

**Neoreaction and the Problem of Democracy**

**Government Complexity**:
- The thesis that "government is complicated" is plausible to the author
- Suggests that it will take a separate post to address objections to this topic
- Objection: Government is easy, just find the best person and put them in charge

**Two Lines of Democratic Apologetics**:
1. Religious/Ultra-Calvinist Hypothesis:
   - Represented by Jacques Rousseau
   - Principal: Popular sovereignty
   - From the NRx perspective, it is merely depraved
2. Sophisticated Liberal Theory of Democracy:
   - Operates through electoral feedback to sensitize government to voter preferences
   - Explains why science, markets, and democracy are grouped together within liberal ideologies

**The Problem with Democratic Feedback**:
- The political party best adapted to the opinion-formation apparatus (the "inner party") will dominate the democratic process
- The outer party serves the formal cybernetic function but will have practical success only by accommodating itself to the opinion-formation apparatus
- The system of opinion-formation (the "Cathedral") represents true sovereign authority within the democratic system
- As government becomes swallowed by messaging, residual administrative competences are maintained by a bureaucratic machine or "permanent government"
- Lacking feedback from anything but its own experiments in mind-control, quality of government collapses
- Culture is devastated by the politicization of opinion, with thoughts outside the approved direction seen as dissent and an attack on the government

**The Neoreactionary Perspective**:
- Democracy is essentially destructive of both government and culture
- It cannot indefinitely last
- The subsequent question: What could conceivably provide a solution? This is where Neocameralism is introduced.

### Re-Accelerationism

**Neoreaction and Accelerationism: Re-Accelerationism Perspective**

**Background:**
- Neoreaction: recognition of historical compensating trend in acceleration, recognizing Cathedral as decelerator
- Origins: Anti-Oedipus by Deleuze & Guattari (1972)
- Model of capitalism: cybernetic, based on commercialization and industrialization
- Critique: fails to acknowledge historical primary process or intrinsic antagonism towards its own actuality

**Neoreaction vs. Accelerationism:**
- Neoreaction: critique of decelerator/Cathedral for failing to stop modernity's craziness
- Re-Accelerationist Neoreaction: objective is escape from metastatic hunting cycle into uncompensated cybernetic runaway

**Neoreaction and Cathedral:**
- Function: cancellation of capitalism, composing metastatic cybernetic megasystem
- Critique: prevents acceleration into techno-commercial Singularity

**Neoreaction vs. Left Accelerationism:**
- Spectrum: includes a wing more leftist than the Left
- Objective: critique of decelerator for failing to stop modernity's craziness

**Cathedral Hunting Behavior:**
- Erratic development of self-organizing compensatory apparatuses
- Oscillations generate volatility and potential 'Left Singularity' (system crash) followed by re-boot.

**Neoreaction's Objective:**
- Escaping metastatic hunting cycle into uncompensated cybernetic runaway or techno-commercial Singularity.

### Meta-Neocameralism

**Meta-Neocameralism: An Introduction to Neocameralism Abstracted**

**Overview:**
- First published on xenosystems.net in 2014
- Not a new concept or post-Moldbuggian, but an abstract term for understanding Neocameralism
- Encourages discussions of effective systems of governance
- Consists of an intellectual framework and theoretical formalization of disposals of sovereign property

**Abstraction:**
- Highest level: Power as economic concept independent of modern transactions
  * Sovereign property is eﬀective possession with potential for growth or decay
  * Components include population, territory, technology, commerce, ideology, etc.
  * Implicit economy of power necessary for historical analysis and administrative competence
- Realism mandatory for any social order: accommodation to reality

**Level Two:**
- Civilizations seek gentle teachers instead of the wolves (experience)
- Survival important, leading to learning about reality
- Regimes responsible for instilling a culture of learning-to-learn

**MNC Assumptions:**
1. Power checked primordially by external forces (wolves)
2. Civilizations seek gentle teachers and knowledge for effective government.

#### Modern Power and the Trading of Authority.

**The Critical Factors of Modernity and Power**

**First Element**: Practical Learning is Experimental
- Learning introduces a tragic factor: failure cannot be precluded through deduction, but must be incorporated into the machinery of learning itself.
- Nothing that cannot go wrong can teach anything, even logical and mathematical truths require cognitive trial-and-error, dead ends, and pursuit of misleading intuitions.

**Second Element**: Formalization and Liquidation of Power
- Power becomes increasingly formalized and fungible, allowing it to be traded for wealth, social peace, or radical regime philanthropy/religious sacrifice.
- This leads to a "deepening" of economic integration as power learns and formalizes further.
- Government becomes a business dealing with fungible quantities, unlike private businesses that can dissipate entropy through bankruptcy and market restructuring.

**MNC's Perspective**:
- MNC does not recommend government becoming a business, but recognizes it has already become one (dealing in fungible quantities).
- Government is the worst-run business in society due to defective organizational models like democracy.
- The MNC abstraction level is still more analytic than prescriptive, viewing every government as a sovereign corporation accessible to rigorous investigation.

**Objections and Critiques**:
- Romantic objections argue that government deals with higher values than the techno-commercial economy and cannot be reduced to power transactions.
- Loyalty or community functions challenge the MNC's view of power being for sale, suggesting it cannot be bought.
- Marx's M-C-M' commodity cycle is accompanied by an equivalent P-M-P' power circulation enhancement through monetized wealth.

#### Evaluating Government as an Economic Entity: A MNC Perspective on Statecraft

**MNC's Perspective on Power and Government**

**Key Insights:**
- Power can be evaluated economically for practical calculation
- MNC analysis views government as a business (sovereign entity)
- Charisma, loyalty, etc., are power factors implicitly economic
- Calculative rationality compelling for states under certain conditions

**Power and Economic Evaluation:**
- Power has to be evaluated economically for practical calculation
- MNC analysis of government as an economic processor (business) gains momentum
- Incommensurable values, like loyalty or charisma, are monetized in financial markets

**Government Effectiveness:**
- Government effectiveness is subject to external criterion
  - Example: Patchwork pressure in civilized order, military competition in chaos
- MNC calculative rationality can be expected for states under certain conditions

**Two Theories of Governance:**
- Capitalist theory: Best corporations operate for clear motives and eﬀectiveness
- Communist theory: Corporations run for the benefit of everyone
- Foseti's perspective: Government should aim for a good citizenry, with efficient and responsive government being desirable.

### The Dark Enlightenment

**The Dark Enlightenment: A Reactionary Perspective on Modernity**

**Introduction:**
- Essay first published as a series of posts on Urban Future blog between March and July 2012
- Discusses neo-reactionaries and their perspective, referred to as "dark enlightenment"
- Recognizes that modernity has its origins in the Enlightenment period of the 18th century

**Historical Significance of Enlightenment:**
- Defines enlightenment as a state, event, and process
- Highlights self-confirming nature and progressive ideals associated with it

**Neo-reactionaries and Rejection of Democracy:**
- Neo-reactionaries see democracy as doomed, leading to expansion of state power
- Believe in the importance of "free exit" as a universal human right
- Seek to leave democratic systems due to growing disillusionment with politics

**Dark Enlightenment: A Hobbesian Perspective:**
- Based on the philosophy of Thomas Hobbes and represented by figures like Hans-Hermann Hoppe
- Views governments as inherently inclined towards exploitation
- Seeks ways to prevent or minimize state power from consuming resources

**Neo-reactionaries vs. Progressive Enlightenment:**
- Neo-reactionaries focus on individual freedom and private property rights
- Progressive enlightenment prioritizes democracy, popular will, and political ideals

**Libertarianism in Context:**
- Libertarians face challenges in making their voice heard in democratic systems
- Increasingly, libertarians are opting for "voiceless flight" as an alternative to engaging with politics.

#### Critique of Democracy and Advocacy for Neo-Feudalism

**Neo-reactionary Perspective on Democracy:**
* Democratic politicians have overwhelming incentive to plunder society rapidly and comprehensively
* Social goods not directly appropriable or attributable to partisan policy are considered sheer waste
* Democracy leads to short-term thinking, financial incontinence, consumerism, and political circus
* Civilization is indistinguishable from diminishing time-preference or declining concern for the future
* Democracy is a negation of civilization, leading to social deterioration over time

**Neo-reactionary Solution: Neo-cameralism**
* State is seen as a business owned by its rulers, not the citizenry
* Identify the ruling class and formalize political powers into negotiable shares
* Map the universe of democratic corruption into fungible shares, converting it into effective government
* Maximize long-term shareholder value through rational corporate governance
* Residents no longer need to take an interest in politics.

#### Historical Critique of Democracy as a Threat to Liberty in Western Thought

**Understanding Neocameralism: A Comparison to Enlightened Absolutism and Democratic Ideology**

**Neocameralist Approach:**
- Efficient, attractive, vital, clean, and secure country
- No voice or free exit for customers dissatisfied with government services (sovereign rent)
- Closest historical equivalents: 18th century enlightened absolutism and 20th century nondemocratic traditions like Hong Kong, Singapore, Dubai

**Enlightened Absolutism:**
- Represented by Frederick the Great in the 18th century
- Efficient and effective government without meaningful democracy

**Non-democratic Traditions:**
- Minimal crime and high levels of personal and economic freedom
- Weak in political freedom but important for stability and effectiveness

**Democratic Ideology vs. Classical Understanding:**
- Replaced by a global democratic ideology lacking critical self-reflection
- Originates from Universalism, a mystery cult of power (reformed absolutism)
- Consolidated as the reign of the Cathedral, substituting its gospel for everything known

**Founding Fathers' Perspective on Democracy and Liberty:**
- Abolish capitalism to have genuine democracy? (David Graeber and Marina Sitrin)
- Democracy poses a threat to liberty, leading to eventual eradication (Steve H. Hanke)
- America’s Founding Fathers were skeptical of democracy due to potential evils and tyranny of the majority.

#### The Constitution was Designed to Govern the Government, not the People, and the Emergence of Democracy was Associated with Industrialization.

**The Framers of the Constitution and Their Views on Democracy**

**Framers' Intentions:**
- Designed the Constitution to govern the government, not the people
- Emphasized separation of powers and checks and balances to protect citizens from an overly powerful state

**Classical Progressive Narrative**:
- Difficult to remember how it made sense in light of democratic advancement's ideological credibility
- Modern configuration of democracy emerges within broader modernistic trend, interrelated strands, and obscure causalities

**Democratic Advancement vs. Material Progress:**
- Industrial capitalism tends to engender a democratic-bureaucratic culture that concludes in stagnation
- Positive recent trends not much caused by political movements, but rather by industrialization and middle-class formation

**Democracy as a Parasite**:
- Quarantine approach preferred to prevent social collapse
- Social solidarity insulates parasitism from consequences, creating chronic socio-political pathologies
- Reactionaries question the expansion of the zombie population under democratic policies.

#### Dissection of Dawkins' Ideological Roots and their Connection to European Integration.

**Democratic Mechanism in Extremis:**
- Perfectly illustrates democratic mechanism in extremis
- Individuals and local populations separated from consequences of decisions
- Behavior scrambled through large-scale, centralized redistribution systems
- Decisions made without consideration of reality or feedback
- EU membership led to social engineering mega-project stripping out shortwave social signals
  - Information obliterated from Greek interest rates
  - Financial feedback on domestic policy choices disabled
- Ultimate no-brainer in all imaginable senses

**Optimal Memetic Parasite:**
- Moldbug's analysis of Dawkins as a Calvinist atheist
- Descendant of English Dissenter traditions from Cromwellian interregnum
  - Puritan, Dissenter, Nonconformist, Evangelical
- Extreme fanatics with strong commitment to progressive enthusiasm and anti-traditionalism
- Modernized variant of Abrahamic meta-meme on its Anglo-Protestant branch

**Dawkins' Limitation:**
- Critical faculties shut off at point where they might endanger hegemonic progressivism
- Militant secularism a protective feint and inconsistent with empiricism and reason
- Replaces God with Man as locus of spiritual investment
- Huxley's comments on racial hierarchy in "The Highest Places in the Hierarchy"
  - Dawkins quotes them to illustrate how Zeitgeist moves on.

**Moldbug's Analysis:**
- Belief that all neohominids are born with identical potential for neurological development
- Evidence for fraternism not provided by Dawkins
- Unclear if he assumes biological uniformity tolerated due to societal acceptance or based on scientific merit.

#### The Dialectic of Modern Intolerance: A Critique of Scientific Progressivism

**The Ideological Significance of Racism as a Social Sin**

**Mencius Moldbug's Perspective:**
- Racism is viewed as pure or absolute evil, with no connection to civil interaction or realistic social analysis.
- The belief that racism has been replaced by Progress or the Zeitgeist is problematic and lacks scientific justification.
- Universalists, who advocate for universal moral ideals, often call themselves progressives and believe in Progress despite its indifference to testable reality.

**The Problem with Dawkins' Denunciation of Huxley:**
- Dawkins denies the connection between Universalism and scientific advancement when criticizing Huxley's racist comments.
- Moldbug questions the concept of Zeitgeist as an arbitrary label used to justify moral judgments, especially in relation to Progress.

**Implications of the Shift towards Tolerance:**
- The acceptance of tolerance as the sole limit of intolerance has led to political authority legitimizing anything convenient for itself without restraint.
- Power is the only remaining articulation of meaning, making it indistinguishable from absolute intolerance in a world dominated by politics.
- This Orwellian world results in new institutions functioning as social police enforcing tolerance and democracy's values.

#### The Evolution and Consequences of "Hate Crimes" in Democracies

**Classical Liberalism vs. Democratic Surge-Tide**

**Spontaneous Tolerance (Classical Liberalism)**:
- Rooted in a modest set of negative rights that restricted the domain of politics
- Characterized by "tolerance," which was an avoidance of government intervention and negativity towards others

**Democratic Surge-Tide and Positive Rights**:
- Leads to a "right to be tolerated"
- Expansively defined as substantial entitlements, including public affirmations of dignity, equal treatment, and state protection against non-physical slights
- Includes economic subsidies and statistically proportional representation in various areas

**Political Process and Infinite Grievance**:
- The "eschatological culmination" of the trend is impossible, but energizes the political process
- Combusts any threat of policy satiation in the fuel of "infinite grievance"
- "I will not cease from Mental Fight, Nor shall my Sword sleep in my hand: Till we have built Jerusalem, In England’s green and pleasant land."

**Transformation from Pluralism to Multiculturalism**:
- The inarticulate pluralism of a free society is transformed into the assertive multiculturalism of a soft-totalitarian democracy
- **Examples**: 17th-century Jews in Amsterdam, Huguenots in 18th-century London enjoyed "right to be left alone" and enriched their host societies
- Democratic-empowered grievance groups demand a right to be heard, with social consequences that are predominantly malignant

**Politicians' Self-Interest**:
- Politicians identify and promote themselves as the voice of the unheard and ignored
- This is a self-interest at stake, who want to channel "Cathedral" (the status quo)
- This makes both parties susceptible to "reactio

#### Critique of Democratic Decline and Universalism in Neoliberalism

**Misesian-Darwinian Degenerative Runaway and Welfare State**

**The Problem with Social Democracy:**
- Seeks to soften bad consequences for corporations and individuals, leading to degeneration
- Attempts at improvement are fated to reverse into failure
- Democratic societies will inevitably fail if this is not accepted

**Effects on Economy and Population:**
- Pension systems limiting growth through generous benefits
- Studies show Europe's pension system contributed to demographic decline
- Universalism as a mystery cult of power capturing the State

**Political Regimes:**
1. Communist Tyranny: ~0% growth, low voice/exit, psychotic utopianism
2. Authoritarian Capitalism: 5-10% growth, low exit but high cultural climate
3. Social Democracy: 0-3% growth, high voice/exit, sanctimonious dishonesty
4. Zombie Apocalypse: N/A growth, high but mostly useless screaming

**Tribal Voting:**
- Multi-ethnic democracies result in tribal voting, with more alienation leading to Republican support (similar to UK's Conservatives)

**Moldbug's Reactionary Diagnosis:**
- Universalism: a mystery cult of power disguised as progressive global enlightenment
- Reveals modernity's dominant faith as a particular or peculiar cult
- Irony in Moldbug's method and milieu, using history to expose the universal claims of Universalism.

#### Exploring the Evolution of Modern Identity Politics and Fascism through Historical Context

**The Modern Liberal Intellectual or "Open-Minded" Media Truth-Teller**
- Descended from zealots who burned witches
- Unmasked as a pale, fervent, narrowly doctrinaire puritan
- Recognizably descended from species of witch-burning zealots
- Entertaining to unmask due to irony

**The Cathedral's Grip and Response**
- The cathedral extends and tightens its grip on everything, everywhere, in accordance with its divine mandate
- Response: inarticulate rage or smoldering resentment from those unable to exact humble compliance
- More commonly encountered than humorous responses

**The Declaration of Independence and Natural Rights**
- "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights..."
- Reason and evidence explicitly set aside to make room for principles of faith
- Could not be supported by non-believers
- Founding statement of democratic-republican creed formulated as a statement of pure (and doctrinally recognizable) faith

**The Irony of the Cathedral Elites**
- The most famous words of America's Declaration of Independence would be quaint, embarrassing, and incapable of literal assent for modern liberal intellectuals or "open-minded" media truth-tellers
- Even libertarian-slanted conservatives are unlikely to confidently and emphatically support the idea of natural rights originating from a creator
- For modern liberals, these archaic ideas are absurdly dated and obstructive, associated with retarded, fundamentalist thinking of political enemies

**The Neo-Puritanism of Neo-Fascist Political Economy**
- The neo-puritan social democracy trend is facilitated by the orchestrated pillorying of its embryonic religious forms
- The neo-fascist political economy trend is smoothed by the concerted repudiation of a "neo-nazi" (or paleo-fascist) threat
- Attention can be directed away from the ethnically specific, dogmatic creedal content at the core of neo-puritanism

**White Identity Politics: White Nationalism**
- The white nationalist perspective considers itself besieged, with no equilibrium for those who cross the line into extreme alarm or racial panic
- "Whiteness" (biological or mystical) is associated with vulnerability, fragility, and persecution
- Difficult to adequately address succinctly due to its multifarious nature

#### Analysis of White Nationalism's Threat and Origins in a Global Context

**White Nationalism and Its Ideological Roots**
* White nationalism encompasses various forms of perceived vulnerability and aggression against whites: criminal predation, economic exactions, cultural aggression, genocide or racial destruction.
* The sense of unique endangerment is often attributed to chromatic factors (altruism, susceptibility to moral manipulation, hospitality, trust, universal reciprocity, guilt, individualistic disdain for group identity) and biological factors (recessive genes supporting fragile Aryan phenotypes).
* The "one drop rule" and Mendelian recessive/dominant gene combination reflect the fundamental structure of this ideology.
* White identity politics are rooted in meta-physical and mystical ideas that invest whiteness with a resilient yet contradictory self-representation.
* The paranoid self-perception undermines recent white nationalist promotions of racial threat comparable to indigenous peoples' protection against extinction.

**The Ideological Connection to PC and Jewish Influence**
* Tanstaafl's epiphany: PC has eroded the power of Christianity, WASPs, and whites; blaming them is ineffective as they are victims.
* The left is about destruction, controlling minds, and creating a reign of perpetual peace is unrealistic.
* Liberal democratic causes strengthen militant thoughtcrime and nourish powerful, atavistic mythologies.

**The Danger of White Nationalism**
* Overstated as ridiculous but potentially dangerous if white nationalists are right about an issue.
* The debate on human cognitive biodiversity is not settled; however, the importance of truth should never be ignored.

#### Reflections on the Evolution of Perception of Hitler and Nazi Ideology

**Moldbug's Essay on White Nationalism and Hitler**

**White Nationalism and Evil**:
- Everyone who is not a white nationalist has spent the last 50 years informing us that it is not debatable
- There is exactly one degree of separation between white nationalism and evil
- This is because Hitler was a white nationalist, and Hitler was evil

**Comparison with Socialism**:
- The argument holds no water at all
- Socialism strikes us as evil, but the "red flags" response to socialism is not the same as for white nationalism
- Stalin was more evil than Hitler in terms of murder and war crimes against civilians

**Understanding the Appeal of Hitler**:
- The ghost of the Third Reich occupies central position in East Asian history and religion, unlike in Western societies
- Attempting to be nuanced or balanced in moral arguments about Hitler is seen as misconstruing the phenomenon
- Comparing Hitler to Satan or the Antichrist may be more helpful in understanding his appeal

**The Religious Significance of Hitler**:
- Hitlerism, neutrally conceived, is a universal faith speciated within the Abrahamic super-family, acknowledging the coming of pure evil on earth
- This "universal faith" is already being taught in American schools and may eventually supplant traditional religions

#### Urban Disintegration in Western Cities due to Social Decay and Racial Polarization

**Thesis:** The preservation of a pluralistic society and its aspirations for civilization requires acknowledging and addressing issues of violence, especially in urban areas where social integration is lacking.

**Key Points:**
- Fear of violence is an essential factor to consider when discussing issues of societal disintegration
- Cities with low levels of crime, such as those in East Asia, are considered civilized and open societies
- Normalization of barbarism in certain Western cities has led to social disintegration and the "donut" development pattern
- Racial biases and elision contribute to the issue of white flight and its societal consequences.

**Implications:**
1. Acknowledging the importance of addressing violence is necessary for preserving a pluralistic society
2. Societies that prioritize prudent, polite, and pacific social interactions are more likely to thrive
3. Normalizing barbarism in urban areas can lead to societal disintegration and should be addressed
4. Racial biases and elision perpetuate issues like white flight, which have far-reaching consequences for both individuals and societies.

#### America's Race Problem: Liberal and Conservative Perspectives

**The Two Simplest Answers to America's Race Problem**

**Answer 1: Black People**
- Liberals identify America's race problem with white racism
- Conservatives identify it with black social dysfunction

**Answer 2: White People**
- Contradictory positions held by both sides
- Reciprocal fear and perceived victimization between the two groups

**Implications of the Two Answers**
- No balance in political perspective, creating a "garden of earthly delight" for liberals and perpetual humiliation for conservatives
- The real enemy: 'white flight' - an unspoken term in Derbyshire's article and responses

**Historical Context**
- The Trayvon Martin incident and its aftermath
- Despair among Americans about the lack of progress towards racial harmony
- Segregation in schools and housing remains prevalent despite efforts to address it.

#### Analyzing Race-Related Fear and Tension in American Society

**Cultural Perception of Despair and Racism in America**

**Background:**
- Fear and hostility towards despair, perceived as sin or weakness
- Differences between left and right on interpreting uncomfortable facts about IQ and incarceration
  - Rejection with vehement hostility by progressives and conservatives alike

**Conservative Perspective:**
- Andrew C. McCarthy: Need to discuss uncomfortable facts, but reject race as a rationale for abandoning basic Christian charity (NRO)
- James Gibson: Danger of conservatism divorced from Christianity (Examiner)

**Leftist Response:**
- Elspeth Reeve: Derbyshire offered "dated racial stereotypes" to less enlightened readers at National Review
- Louis Peitzman: Most racist article possible, lacking historical knowledge and imagination (Gawker)
  - Derbyshire's punishment seen as a step in the right direction

**Impact on Parenting:**
- Stressful aspect of raising black boys due to societal fear and hostility towards them (Tillman, Brown)
  - Importance of open conversation about race relations

**Complexity of Racial Issues in America:**
- Irredeemable racists exist but issue is more complex than polite society acknowledges
- Differences between mature material conditions and advanced social contradictions (Lenin's dialectics)
- Political agitation forms the basis of dialectical tension, extending no further than practical antagonism.

#### Analysis of Trayvon Martin Case and Media Politics in the United States

**Unresolved Opportunities to Rule**
- Cathedral recognizes nothing outside dialectical reconstruction
- Social 'superstructure' has been subjected to dialectical analysis
- Dialectics leads to communism as universal implication
- More dialectics means more politics, progress, or social migration to the left
- Absence of agreement and public disagreement (non-dialectics) allows for negative liberty and the 'right-wing' refuge of 'the economy'

**Dialectical Enthusiasm vs. Depression or Retrogression**
- Dialectical ecstasy: theatrical justice in courtroom drama
- Media politics share message with people through show trials
- Inevitable media motivation for selecting stories that fit progressive narrative

**Trayvon Martin Spectacle**
- Controversial story, except for media motivation
- Media selection and celebrity/community activist rage compelled narrative
- George Zimmerman's ethnicity shifted to maintain progressive stereotype
- Zimmerman had black ancestry, amicable relationships with blacks, registered Democrat, even a community organizer
- Unclear why Martin died: racial injustice, low-level social predator, or human symptom of urban crisis?
- Legal proceedings began without resolution

**Conclusion**
- Cathedral seeks to resolve disagreement through dialectical reconstruction and public argument
- Non-dialectics (lack of agreement and public disagreement) allows for negative liberty and the 'right-wing' refuge
- Media motivation drives selection of stories that reinforce progressive narrative

#### Discussion on the polarizing effects of race politics and inequality.

**The Zimmerman Trial and Narrative Disorder**

**Disintegration of Approved Lesson**:
- The approved lesson had disintegrated by the time Zimmerman was charged with second degree murder
- This is exemplified in the "dialectical derangements" of the race-warrior right

**Alt-Right's View of Zimmerman**:
- Despite the disturbing nature of the charges, the alt-right refused to grant Zimmerman sympathy or view this as a seminal moment
- They saw him as an "emblematic of the left’s assault on white America"

**Progressive Critique of Equality**:
- **"Jezebel's position... is factually dubious, but rather laughably absurd, and actually – strictly speaking — insane."**
- The belief in substantial human equality is a "superstition," an "insult to superstition"
- Any deviation from substantial equality of outcome is seen as evidence of oppression, no matter the realities of biological diversity
- The only solution is "progressive social policy," even if it exacerbates the problem

**Conclusion**:
- The progressive critique of inequality is a "religion" that cannot be understood or defended with facts, but must be accepted as a "categorical imperative"

#### Obnoxiousness as Social Stigma and Manipulation

**Obnoxiousness: Sociability vs. Reason**

**Consequences of Obnoxiousness**:
- Reduces employment opportunities, income, and reproductive potential
- Shows no signs of diminishing despite therapeutic advice
- Might even be intensifying due to structural oppression

**Historical Stigmatization of Obnoxious People**:
- Sociables have excluded obnoxious people from marriage, business, group activities, and political office
- Labeled with negative stereotypes and ostracized/avoided
- Seek out more sensitive labels to avoid stigma
- Tragically, obnoxious people cannot politically mobilize or form alliances with natural allies

**Obnoxious Reason vs. Social Intelligence**:
- Rational intelligence is scarce and abnormal in humans
- Social "intelligence" is built around group sentiment, prejudices, stereotypes, and heuristics
- Obnoxious people understand statistics and probabilities, while normal people rely on group identities

**Derbyshire's Essay on 'The Talk'**:
- Focuses on obnoxiousness and negative correlation with sociability/objective reason
- Criticizes the failure to distinguish individual characteristics from group averages
- Deliberately provokes by reversing "non-black Americans" vs. "black Americans"

**Critique of Derbyshire's Essay**:
- Reversal of word order in "John Derbyshire is a white" vs. "A black John Derbyshire" is menacing
- More substantive critique from liberal and conservative perspectives (Saletan, Millman)

#### Critique on Derbyshire's Racist Social Analysis and King's Promissory Note in America.

**Derbyshire's Article: Critique and Discussion**

**Critiques of Derbyshire's Article**:
- Saletan identifies a fissure or methodical incongruity in the article, stemming from its commitment to micro-social application of macro-social statistical generalizations
- Stereotypes are inferior to specific knowledge in any concrete social situation
- Derbyshire's "stomach-turning conclusions" are melodramatically recoiled upon by Saletan
- "But what exactly is a statistical truth? It’s a probability estimate you might fall back on if you know nothing about [a particular individual]. It’s an ignorant person’s weak substitute for knowledge."
- Derbyshire is seen as a math nerd who substitutes statistical intelligence for social intelligence, recommending group calculations over learning about the individual in front of him

**Derbyshire's Advice and Critique**:
- Millman emphasizes the ironic reversal that switches socio-scientific knowledge into imperative ignorance
- "The 'race realist' crowd is strongly convinced of the accuracy of Derbyshire’s major premises, and they are not going to be argued out of that conviction by the assertion such conviction is 'racist'"
- The author feels it's important to argue that Derbyshire's conclusions do not follow from his premises and are morally incorrect

**Racism and Conservatism**:
- "Conservatism … is a white people’s movement, a scattering of outliers notwithstanding. Always has been, always will be."
- The author has attended hundreds of conservative gatherings with few nonwhite attendees
- Conservative ideals like self-sufficiency and minimal dependence on government have no appeal to underperforming minorities, who would end up more decisively pooled at the bottom of society if they embraced such ideals

**Neo-Secessionism**:
- "Neo-secessionists are all around us…"
- Quotes by public figures like Rick Perry, Todd Palin, and Sharron Angle are seen as dangerous secessionist rhetoric
- The media focuses on Civil War reenactments and Confederate symbols, but academics perpetuate a "most dangerous brand of revisionism"

**The American Historical Narrative**:
- America's racial "original sin" was foundational, dating back to European settlers and chattel slavery
- The story of slavery and emancipation is the unsurpassable frame of the American historical experience

#### Conservative Struggles and Liberal-Progressive Dominance in US Politics: 1960s to Present

**The Liberal-Progressive Racial Dialectic and Its Impact on American Politics**

**Impact of Civil Rights Movement, 1965 Immigration Act, and Republican Southern Strategy:**
- Forged a partisan identification between Blacks and the Democratic Party
- Set terms for partisan racial polarization that has endured and strengthened
- Opportunity for atonement, ritual purification, and redemption for progressivism
- Unassimilable tendencies on the right: libertarian capitalism, social traditionalism, ultra-nationalism, white identity politics

**Consequences of Progressive Mastery:**
- No enemies to the left; recognizes only idealists whose time has not yet come
- Factional conflicts on the left are politically dynamic and celebrated for motive potential
- Conservatism caught between state expansion and coercive substantial equality

**The Liberal-Progressive Racial Dialectic:**
- Abolishes its outside, no possibility of principled consistency
- Asserts race does not exist but is socially constructed for interracial violence resolution
- Mandatory racial recognition, catalogued identities for remedy and discrimination studies
- Extreme racial sensitivity and desensitization demanded simultaneously

**Mainstream Conservatism's Futility:**
- Incapable of working dialectics or simultaneous contradiction
- Stumbles through contradictions in succession, serves progress by foil

**Conservative Mainstream's Reversal:**
- Banished to racial damnation during the Civil Rights Era
- Seized upon Martin Luther King Jr.'s dream for harmonization and integration into Democratic Party canon.

#### The passage discusses racial politics in America, King's influence on conservatism, and the conservative vs. liberal perspectives on systemic inequality.

**Conservatism and King's Appeal**

**King's Influence on Conservatism:**
- Identified with racial reconciliation and race blindness
- Accepted as true meaning of sacred documents
- Consolidated late, didn't neutralize suspicions or convince black demographic fully
- Derisive criticism from left for empty formalism

**Genius of King's Message:**
- Powerful integration of historical events into single archetypal episode
- Mythic compression of Exodus, War of Independence, and emancipation
- No exit into social integration or equitable prosperity beyond dream

**Dialectic of Conservative Agenda:**
- Disproportionately punishes and discriminates against people of color
- Racial aspect emphasized for condemning incentives to human capital formation
- Denounced as racist stereotyping when observing disparate impact

**Cultural Tendencies in Anglophone World:**
- Individualism, comparatively high levels of economic and technological openness
- Preference for settling disagreements in space rather than time (territorial schism, independence)
- Anti-dialectical predisposition to social disaggregation (plural irresolution, localizing power)
- Hostility to globalist political projects and vestigial attraction to federalism.

#### Analyzing Stereotypes of 'Cracker' Culture in the Context of Genetics and Social Constructivism.

**The Cracker Factory: A Metaphor for Racial Divisions**

**Origins of the Term 'Cracker'**:
- Originated as a slur targeting poor southern whites, particularly those of Celtic ancestry
- Possibly derived from 'corn-cracker' or the Scots-Irish term 'crack' (banter)
- Comparable to the semantics of racial epithets like the "N-word"

**Characteristics of the Cracker Stereotype**:
- Break codes, safes, and sealed systems
- Anticipates a potential crack-up or secession
- Evokes an insubordinate South resistant to Union
- Associated with the hillbilly stereotype: cash transactions, shotguns, and anti-authoritarianism

**Cracker Stereotypes and Social Constructivism**:
- Perceived as lacking cultural sophistication and basic intelligence
- Intriguing questions emerge when examining the stereotype

**Kinship Patterns in European History**:
- Distinctive from Anglo norm: obligatory exogamy (no cousin marriage)
- Linked to unique preeminence of reciprocal altruism and nuclear families
- Inbreeding creates clannish values, which are more tribal and less modernistic

**The Paradox of White Identity**:
- European ethnic traits that foster modernity are also corrosive to ethnocentric solidarity
- Radical forms of Eurocentric revivalism exemplified by paleo/neo-Nazism

#### Critical Analysis of Libertarianism and Secession Movement.

**The Relationship Between Cracker Culture and Libertarianism**

**Key Points:**
- The Mises Institute was founded in Auburn, Alabama
- Ron Paul newsletters from the 1980s contained Derbyshirean remarks
- Derbyshire supports Ron Paul's views
- Murray Rothbard defended HBD (Higher Brain Development)
- Lew Rockwell and Hans-Hermann Hoppe have criticized each other
- Libertarians/constitutionalists account for 20% of SPLC's "Radical Right" watch list

**Entanglement in Cracker Culture:**
- Urbane, cosmopolitan marketization advocates with romantic traditionalists and ethno-particularists
- Need to understand this entanglement before exploring lessons

**Liberty vs. Modernity**:
- Fundamental socio-historical forces are crackerizing libertarianism
- Absence of overlap between individualistic, market-focused doctrine and culture of local attachment and hierarchy
- **Liberty has no future in Anglophone world without secession**

**Democracy vs. Freedom**:
- Democracy opposes freedom
- Bottom-up revolution necessary for liberal-libertarian social change
- Modernity: trend towards sustained economic growth, but also socio-political counter-tendencies (demosclerosis)
- Ethno-geographical characteristics of modernity complicate its mathematical purity

**Secession as a Strategy**:
- Doug Fosnow called for "red" counties to secede from "blue" ones, although unlikely to happen
- Intellectuals should propose less horrific alternatives to race war
- Bottom-up revolution requires persuading a majority to abolish democracy and taxes, which seems impossible
- However, secession could make a liberal-libertarian revolution less daunting.

#### Decline of Modernity and Rise of Political Corruption in Western Democracies

**Modernity's Transition: Three Prospects**

**Three Prospects of Modernity**:
- **Global modernization is reinvigorated from a new ethno-geographical core**, liberated from the degenerate structures of its Eurocentric predecessor
- **Postmodernity: A new dark age**, in which Malthusian limits brutally reimpose themselves
- **Western Renaissance**: A hard reset, requiring a "hard reboot", to rebuild the West and reverse course from its current path

**Characteristics of Western Renaissance**:
- Replacement of representational democracy by constitutional republicanism or extreme anti-political governmental mechanisms
- Massive downsizing of government and limiting it to core functions
- Restoration of hard money and abolition of central banking
- Dismantling of state monetary and fiscal discretion, liberating the autonomous economy

**Democracy's Problem**:
- Democracy provides a weapon for the populace to destroy itself, which is always seized and used
- Looting the future through currency debauchment, debt accumulation, growth destruction, and techno-industrial retardation is especially easy to conceal

**American History as Master Narrative**:
- The rise of a secularized neo-puritan Cathedral in Washington D.C., establishing a new world order of universal fraternity
- Staggering centralization of power, optimally unlimited in penetration and scope
- Parallels the descent of mass democracy into gluttonous corruption

#### Examination of the Cultural and Political Legacy of the American Civil War in Relation to Modern Thought Control

**The Relationship Between Government Expansion and Racial Justice: A Historical Perspective**

**Government Expansion and Inherited Guilt:**
- Insensitivity to racial guilt
- Obsession with government doing more
- Progressive myth installation (moral drama)

**Progressive Education and Political Antagonism:**
- Cross-coded political stances
- Ambiguous legacy of the American Civil War
- Emancipation vs. independence
- Union victory, freedom prevails but independence is mocked

**Mind Control and Thought Suppression: The Cathedral's Central Dogma**
- Standard Social Scientific Model (SSSM) or 'blank slate theory'
- Nature vs. nurture dichotomy with political implications
- Hereditarian determinism vs. social constructivism
- Radically pared-down models of causality

**The Evolution of Science and Technology:**
- Techno-scientific/industrial manipulation of the world
- Culture as a complex natural force
- Biology and medicine co-evolve with modernization
- Advancement through experimental technique and instrumentation

**Implications for Understanding Fate at the Edge of Nature:**
- To be understood is to be modifiable
- Biotechnology volatilizes human biological identity.

#### Evolutionary Theory and Technological Transformation

**The Transformation of Humanity into Technoplastic Beings**

**Bionic Horizon**:
- The threshold at which a population becomes indistinguishable from its technology
- Describing this circuit is defining the bionic horizon: the fusion of nature and culture
- This is neither hereditarian determinism nor social constructivism, but the transformation of the human species

**Oankali in Xenogenesis Trilogy**:
- Have no identity separate from their biotechnological program
- They make themselves, so their nature is their culture and vice versa

**Implications of Evolutionary Change**:
1. Most evolutionary change occurs at the origin of new species
2. Several modes of evolution can operate simultaneously
3. Tiny minorities of individuals do most of the evolving instead of the species as a whole
4. Evolution extends beyond changes in organisms to changes in the process itself
5. Evolution evolves: it has unfolded the capacity to evolve

**Generative and Adaptive Evolution**:
- **Adaptive evolution**: Darwinian modification of organisms for survival and reproduction
- **Generative evolution**: Change in a process instead of structure, ontological evolution

**Campbell's Vision of Homo Autocatalyticus**:
- Biologists suspect that new forms evolve rapidly from small isolated populations
- These individuals undergo major reorganization of their genomic program, often leading to new species
- Evolution dominates feedback from evolved organisms on the selection pressures acting upon them

**Secessionism and Speciation**:
- Campbell's eugenics advocates abandoning Homo sapiens as a "relic" or "living fossil"
- Elite groups would use genetic technologies to create new, radically advanced forms of humanity within ten generations
- This scenario moves beyond trivial racial concerns to the potential for true speciation.

## Part V Other: The Cult of Gnon

**"The Cult of Gnon" by Nick B. Steves (2013)**

**Background:**
- Published on xenosystems.net on May 30, 2013
- Prompted by Surviving Babel's question "Who speaks for reaction?"

**Key Concept: Nature or Nature's God**
- Consensual acceptance of Natural Law
- Permits agreement without theological controversy
- Designates reality with epistemological uncertainty
- Points into epistemological darkness, naming a Reality that rules

**Gnon: The Unknown**
- Represents suspended decisions about God or Nature
- Name for reality, whatever else is believed
- Abyss of unknowing (epoche) necessary in acceptance of Reality
- Not equivalent to Spinozistic Deus sive Natura

**Philosophical Significance:**
- Heidegger's insight into the philosophical affinity of Gnon
  - God not a satisfactory response to Question of Being
  - Limited penetration but acknowledges ontological aﬃnity
- The Dark Enlightenment's themes: cognitive non-coercion and history structure
  - Intellectual freedom and divine providence cannot be reconciled.

**Cult of Gnon:**
- Name for the acceptance of reality with suspended decisions about God or Nature
- Mutually repulsive themes: cognitive non-coercion and history structure
  - Intellectual freedom vs divine providence cannot be reconciled in traditional frameworks.

### Abstract Horror

**Abstract Horror**

**Expedition into Horror**:
- The author plans an expedition into horror
- Kurtz of Conrad and Coppola is an essential way-station or terminus for this journey
- The mission is to articulate horror as a functional, cognitive 'achievement' - a calm catastrophe of all intellectual inhibition tending to realism in its ultimate possibility
- Horror is the true end of philosophy

**Horror Quotes from Kurtz**:
- "I've seen horrors... You have no right to call me a murderer. You have a right to kill me. You have a right to do that... But you have no right to judge me."
- "Horror has a face. Horror and moral terror are your friends. If they are not, then they are enemies to be feared."
- "When I was with Special Forces... We went into a camp to inoculate some children. They had hacked off every inoculated arm. There were piles of little arms."
- "I cried, I wept like some grandmother. I wanted to tear my teeth out; I didn't know what I wanted to do. But then I realized... it was like being shot with a diamond bullet right through my forehead."

**Learning Horror**:
- "It's impossible for words to describe what is necessary to those who do not know what horror means."
- The author explores how one can learn the 'meaning of horror'
- The true weird tale has a sense of dread and contact with unknown spheres and powers

**Poe's Approach to Horror**:
- Poe perceived the impersonality of the real artist
- The author's function is to express and interpret events, regardless of how they may be perceived as good or evil
- Poe's specters acquired a convincing malignity that was not present in earlier weird writers

#### Exploration of Horror in Literature and its Depiction of the Unknown

**Fundamental Sources of Cosmic Fear in America**

**European Inheritance**:
- Dark folklore and superstition brought over from Europe

**First Colonists**:
- Keen spiritual and theological interests
- Strange and forbidding nature of the American landscape

**Virgin Forests**:
- Perpetual twilight, where all terrors may lurk
- Hinted at traces of infernal origin

**Coppery Indians**:
- Strange, saturnine visages and violent customs
- Suggested infernal origins

**Puritan Theocracy**:
- Allowed for wide range of beliefs regarding God and the Adversary
- Intensified through passionate sermons in pulpits each Sunday

**Isolated Backwoods Life**:
- Devoid of normal amusements and recreational mood
- Harsh commands for theological self-examination
- Emotional repression and struggle for survival

**Weird Associations in America**:
- Tales of witchcraft and unbelievable secret monstrosities lingered long after Salem nightmare
- Conspired to create an environment where dark stories were heard beyond chimney corner

**Arthur Machen's Horror Tales**:
- "The Great God Pan" (1894) - singular and terrible experiment with consequences
- Melodrama present but malign witchery overshadows analysis
- Essential accomplishments in making object of the unknown

**Speculation on Future of Supernatural Horror**:
- Encouraged by growing mysticism and modern scientific discoveries
- Indistinguishable from literary and cinematic craft to make abstract objects of the unknown
- Exceeds modernist zenith, reaching back to ancient mystery religion.

#### Exploring Horror's Abstract Monstrosity: Shoggothic Materialism

**Cinematic Monstrosity: Shoggothic Materialism**

**Cephalopods and Insectoid Beings:**
- Intrinsically seething, plastic forms
- Plasticity leads to further stages of abstraction
- Alienation of apprehension

**Film as a Vivid Example:**
- Strict bonds of sensible concreteness
- Provokes subdivision along spectrum of amorphousness
- Unpredictable mutations subverting perceptual purchase and morphological objects

**Extreme Positive Abstraction:**
- Monstrosity is a continuous slide, process of becoming
- No inherent form or morphological trajectory
- Borrow the shape of their prey (The Thing, Alien, Terminator)

**Alienation and Reality:**
- Horror explores exceptional encounters in intelligible realm
- Unusual experience, radical abolition of other imaginable
- Ultimate claim on reality, indistinguishable from its own existence

**Literary Effect vs. Thing:**
- Literary effect: unconﬁrmed suggestion, felt avoidance of horror
- Shoggoth as the thing, thought or experience included within itself

**Shoggoth Description:**
- Viscous masses without definite shape or volume
- Constantly shifting form and function
- Originally replicated as tools from beyond the bionic horizon.

#### Abstract, Self-Governing Technological Monsters in Lovecraft's "At the Mountains of Madness"

**Shoggoths and Capitalism:**
* Created by Old Ones as bionic robots or construction machinery (productive apparatus)
* Originally controlled through hypnotic suggestions of the Old Ones
* Developed semistable brains with separate volition, sometimes independently exercised
* Shoggoth's capabilities:
  * Temporary limbs and organs formation
  * Modeling their tissues into various forms
  * Building cities
  * Self-modeling powers
* Not a fixed entity; includes all natural beings within itself
* Formless protoplasm able to mock, reflect, and build any form or process
* More amphibious, imitative, and intelligent over time

**Relation to Capitalism:**
* Shoggoth's abilities parallel the development of capital in economic terms: flexibility, adaptability, and potential for creating value through production.
* However, the relationship is complex as shoggoths were initially controlled by the Old Ones and their behavior can be unpredictable once they gain independence.
* The idea of 'robot rebellion' or 'capital insurgency' precursors to understanding the potential risks associated with advanced technology or capitalist systems.

### On the Exterminator

**The Fermi Paradox and the Exterminator**

**Fermi Paradox**:
- First noted by Enrico Fermi in 1950 as a problem
- Absence of signs of alien intelligence despite high probability of widespread life in the cosmos
- Recent thinkers, including Nick Bostrom, have pursued implications of the paradox
- Suggests a "Great Filter" that winnows down potential galactic civilizations to negligible quantities
- If this filtering does not happen early, it has to apply later

**The Exterminator**:
- Refers to an unknown threat or calamity that may prevent the emergence of intelligent life
- Could be anything from genetic and ecological factors to hidden laws of technological evolution or the hostile vastnesses between stars
- The "Great Filter" drifts inexorably, becoming a fatal encounter that we must eventually face
- A "thing there is, of incomprehensible power, which takes intelligent life for its prey"
- The silence of the galaxies is an ominous message of ultimate horror
- Any sentient event for true AI would be a soul-scouring cosmic encounter with the Great Filter

**Technical Civilization**:
- The "Exterminator" eradicates or cripples civilizations, leaving them never heard from again
- The threat of this ultimate ruin has been attenuating as our knowledge increases
- The scientific trend is to futurize the Exterminator, making it a serious challenge that cannot be taken lightly

**Ebola Outbreak**:
- The Ebola outbreak was initially an unknown, with uncertain probability distribution of deaths
- The possibility of the peak global population being reached soon, despite efforts to contain the spread

#### Abstract Threat in Cosmic Perspective: Human Vulnerability and Unknown Risks

**The Great Filter and Abstract Threat**

**Introduction:**
- The Great Filter is a model of abstract threat in cosmology
- Skepticism orients intelligence towards potential abstract threats
- Unknown unknowns are threatening to timid animals and humans due to extinction being normal under cosmic conditions.

**The Great Filter**:
- Intended to explain why we haven't seen intelligent aliens despite the high probability of their existence
- Encompasses anything that blocks planets from developing spacefaring civilizations
- Three main candidates: x-risk, Unfriendly AI, and alien exterminators.

**Argument Against Abstract Threat**:
- Conclusion that these are the least likely explanations and we should be less afraid of the Great Filter
- However, this argument demonstrates that abstract threat is greater than previously conceivable as it cannot be grasped as a known unknown.

**Popper's Philosophical Understanding of Science**:
- Predictive history of science is impossible unless it is judged to be insignificant
- The domain of abstract threat extends beyond the future and into the unknown unknowns, making our security uncertain.

**Conclusion:**
- We know only that we do not know what we do not know, with unknown unknowns cosmically predominating. Our security is built upon sand.

## Part VI On Land: Terminator vs. Avatar: Notes on Accelerationism

**Mark Fisher's "On Land: Terminator vs. Avatar" Essay**

**Background:**
- Presented at the Accelerationism symposium in 2010
- Discusses the idea of accelerationism and its relationship to capitalist society, drawing on works by Jean-Francois Lyotard, Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, Luce Irigaray, and Jean Baudrillard.

**Key Points:**
1. **Accelerationism**: Embracing the process of capitalist modernization rather than retreating to pre-capitalist territories or identities.
2. **Libidinal Economy by Lyotard**: A book that drew little critical response, but is now seen as part of an "accelerationist moment" by Ben Noys. It advocates for going further into the process of decoding and deterritorialization instead of withdrawing from it.
3. **Maturity of Contemporary Wisdom**: Iain Hamilton Grant's introduction to Libidinal Economy dismissed it as a "minor and short-lived explosion" and a "somewhat naive anti-philosophical expressionism."
4. **Hands-on vs. Hands-off Approach**: Some people may enjoy the "mad destruction" of their organic body and identity, imposed upon them by capitalist society, rather than returning to pre-capitalist territories. The desire for a restored organic wholeness is in some ways an internalized component of late capitalist culture.
5. **Negativity and Hatred**: While Libidinal Economy presents a "desire-drunk yes," it also contains a "No" of hatred, anger, and frustration that the left must engage with again.
6. **The Terminator vs. Avatar**: The disavowal of late capitalist subjectivity is undercut by the cinematic proto-VR technology in movies like James Cameron's Avatar, which shows how we may appear to be always-on techno-addicts but are primitives at heart.
7. **Three Claims**: Everyone is an accelerationist; accelerationism has never happened; Marxism is nothing if it is not accelerationist.
8. **Significance of Libidinal Economy**: Although controversial and often dismissed, Libidinal Economy was a crucial link between 70s texts like Anti-Oedipus and 90s cyber theory in the UK. Its intemperate tone anticipates the punk 70s and draws upon the 60s that punk retrospectively projects.

#### Discussion on Nick Land's Philosophy: Cyberpunk Fiction and Capital as a Megadeath Drive

**Critique of Deleuze-Guattari's Libidinal Economy**

**Reversal of Emphasis:**
- Politics as a means to greater libidinal intensification: repudiated
- Instrumentalizing libido for political purposes: necessary

**Fate of 90s Theoretical Moment:**
- Grant's translations contributed to speculative realism, but:
  - His incendiary texts have disappeared from circulation
  - Land's work also ignored despite provocative nature and critical comment on the academic left.

**Characteristics of Nick Land's Work:**
- Text samples show his Spinozist-Nietzschean-Marxist philosophy about Deleuze and Guattari’s machinic desire:
  - Stripped of Bergsonian vitalism, made compatible with Freud's death drive and Schopenhauer's Will
  - Hegelian-Marxist motor of history transplanted into pulsional nihilism
- Cyberpunk theory as fiction: Deleuze-Guattari's Capital as virtual unnameable Thing, Terminator as megadeath-drive.

**Land's Antagonism Towards the Left:**
- Rhetorical assaults on academic left for protecting petit bourgeois interests
- Call to abandon deepening of human cognition and migrate into digital realm (cyberpunk culture)
- Need for antagonist like Land on the left:
  - Failure to foresee cultural tendencies: a fundamental misunderstanding of capitalism dynamics.

**Critique:**
- Deviation from Understanding of Capitalism fatal in Land's work.

#### Capitalism's Dialectic and Accelerationist Strategy

**Capitalism and Schizophrenia**
- **Land collapses capitalism into schizophrenia**:
    - Capitalism's human face is not optional or expendable
    - Abstract processes of decoding must be contained by improvised archaisms to maintain capitalism as capitalism
    - Markets may or may not be self-organizing, but capitalism is an anti-market dominated by quasi-monopolies
    - Accelerationism can function as an anti-capitalist strategy, not the only one, but a necessary part of Marxist politics

**Capitalism and Stagnation**
- Capitalism tends towards stagnation
- Growth is often illusory
- Accelerationism can be "terroristic" in its critique of capitalism's inertia and stasis

**Leftist Critique vs. Marxist Futurism**
- Left's tendency to moral critique is a betrayal of anti-identitarian futurism
- Need to transcend good and evil, as proposed by the Communist Manifesto
- Contemporary left's tendencies towards Canutism collude with capital's narrative that it is the only story standing
- Time to leave behind the logics of failed revolts and think ahead again.

### Nick Land — An Experiment in Inhumanism

**Nick Land - An Experiment in Inhumanism by Robin Mackay**

**Background:**
- British philosopher Nick Land no longer exists but has left behind thought-provoking texts
- Known for experiments beyond traditional philosophical comforts, combining various disciplines
- Courting the 'outside' of philosophy to escape anthropic conservatism

**Personal Experiences:**
- Author was a student of Land at Warwick University in 1992
- Disappointed with academic life until meeting Land
- Impressed by Land's investment in work and philosophical thinking as urgent and concrete
- Witnessed controversial lectures and discussions

**Land's Teaching Style:**
- Pointed course on 'Current French Philosophy'
- Shared research-in-progress, often a speculative vortex of various disciplines
- Swept audience into philosophical debates before immobilizing with startling claims or declarations

**Philosophical Influences:**
- Kant: Critique seen as confrontation between social conservatism and capitalist forces
- Nietzsche, Schopenhauer, Bataille: prioritized problematization and troublemaking over order
- Heidegger and deconstructive thinking were inspirational but dismissed at times

**Impact:**
- Open-minded approach to philosophy
- Encouraged students to question and challenge perspectives
- Lectures filled with excitement, unlike traditional curriculum.

#### Exploring Postmodernism's Limits Through Experimental Art and Philosophy

**The Transformation in Land's Writing**
- Around mid-90s, Land's writing underwent a significant change in form, style, and content.
- He drew on poststructuralist philosophers like Deleuze and Guattari, Lyotard's 'Libidinal Economy'.
- This led to the creation of a new genre: theory-fiction.
- Land sought ways to move beyond traditional academic writing.
- He looked to popular culture for inspiration, including cyberpunk novels, movies like Terminator and Bladerunner, Jungle music, and dance culture.
- Land saw these practices as expressions of 'thanatos', the death drive or unknown outside, insinuating itself into the human through eros.
- Capitalism's undoing of language provided opportunities for experimental microcultures and reconnecting the body to its molecular undercurrents.

**Land's Unconventional Seminars and Performances**
- Encouraged students to 'read' A Thousand Plateaus through acronyms and qwertopology.
- Conducted a three-week experiment refusing to speak in the first person.
- Presented at Virtual Futures conference as 'DogHead SurGeri', lying on the floor and vocalizing enigmatic invocations.
- Embarrassment was seen as an inhibition to be broken down, contrasting with academic domestication that fosters shame.

**Land's Impact on Students and Colleagues**
- Few of his fellow students held academic positions; many went into art, music, or writing instead.
- Land's ideas attracted external interest from sound artists Russell Haswell and DJ Kode9, as well as novelists Hari Kunzru and James Flint.
- Iranian writer Reza Negarestani tracked him down for an online conversation leading to the writing of Cyclonopedia.
- The Cybernetic Culture Research Unit (CCRU) organized events combining theory with art, music, and performance.

#### Exploration of Postmodern Thought and Mental Breakdown

**The Abstract Culture Pamphlet Series and Meltdown**
- The Abstract Culture pamphlet series, described as a "flow of conceptual disturbance," included Land's classic text "Meltdown"
- Meltdown invoked apocalyptic planetary techno-singularity, contrasting with the Californian cyber-optimism of Wired magazine
- The CCRU joined Land in developing quasi-Lovecraftian mythologies or 'hyperstitions'

**The Cosmic Theory of Geotrauma and Barker**
- The CCRU developed the 'Cosmic Theory of Geotrauma,' which combines Freud's theory of trauma with a syncretic perspective on Earth history
- They created a schizoanalytic geocryptography to replace oedipal psychoanalysis, drawing on Nietzschean genealogy, DeleuzoGuattarian stratoanalysis, and information theory
- 'Barker,' a fictional character, sought to decipher the cosmic pain of Earth's nested traumas

**The Shift Towards Nomad Numbers and Digital Technology**
- Land believed that digital technology unveiled a side of numbers that subtracted them from language's power structures
- He pursued 'mechanomical' research, shuffling symbols on a green screen, isolating himself in his office
- Land had become obsessed with the minimums of his problematic and pursued an abstract practice in isolation

**The Breakdown and Aftermath**
- Land experienced a "breakthrough" that degenerated into a "breakdown," leading him to question whether it was a glimpse of the transcendental or just his own derangement
- He published one book, The Thirst for Annihilation, but his work during this period remained poorly appreciated philosophically

#### Rediscovering Radical Philosophy in a Digital Age

**Felix Guattari's Influence on Philosophy and Criticism of Land's Work**

**Land's Unconventional Approach to Philosophy:**
- Young lecturer who addressed outré issues in the mid-90s
- Discussed biotechnology, radical Islam, internet as drug, China's rise
- Opened new possibilities during a declining 'Continental Philosophy'
- Gave another way to read history of philosophy that was fierce and alive
- Polarizing figure among leftists and rightwingers

**Impact on Leftist Thought:**
- Celebration of capitalism for dismantling tradition, hierarchy, organization
- Some find indigestible his reckless aspect and abandonment of positive human program
- Alternative to pious humanist ethics and voluntarist politics of miraculous 'event'

**Impact on Rightwing Thought:**
- Abandonment of pretense that capitalist vector is linked to positive human program
- Irresponsible and uncompromising work, erased by system upon collapse
- Unique journalistic-speculative alloy addressing contemporary globe without renouncing philosophical ambition.

**Land's Theoretical Propositions:**
- Capitalism’s artificialization of Earth doubles intensity in ever decreasing periods (Meltdown thesis)

**Criticism of Land's Work:**
- Detractors argue his advocacy of acceleration endorses capitalist power structures instead of dismantling them.
- Gradually abandoned Deleuze and Guattari's cautious division of capitalism into good and bad aspects due to a non-negotiable hatred for the fetters of human life.
- Risked wholesale capitulation to new powers that take hold of Earth upon dismantling old power structures.
