Self-remembering is an active practice for observing oneself, distinct from meditation but sharing some similarities. It aims to develop consciousness and free will, moving individuals through different levels of awareness.

The practice involves understanding the interplay between essence (innate qualities) and personality (learned behaviors), as well as recognizing the various "centers" within oneself (mind, body, emotions, etc.). By observing these aspects without judgment, practitioners can gain deeper self-awareness and potentially access higher states of consciousness.

The Enneagram system is presented as a complementary tool for self-exploration, helping individuals identify core anxieties and patterns of behavior. This system, along with the concept of "On Your Graham," provides a framework for understanding personal development and growth paths.

The discussion also touches on the historical evolution of human consciousness, referencing theories about the development of internal monologue and ego. It suggests that human consciousness has undergone significant changes throughout history, from the bicameral mind of ancient times to the more individualized and abstract sense of self in modern era.

**Self Remembering: A Discussion on Consciousness Practice**

**Introduction:**
- Welcome to the discussion on self remembering
- Brief history of self remembering as a practice
- Similarities to meditation but more active
- Evolution of consciousness and need for growth
- Validation through ancient and modern psychological systems

**Background:**
- Definition of Self Remembering: a guided system for observing oneself
- Comparison with meditation
- Incorporation of various ancient psychological practices
- Role in consciousness development

**Brain Processes:**
- Task Positive Network (TPN) and Default Mode Network (DMN)
- Association with cognitive neuroscience tasks
- Activation of TPN leads to quieting of DMN
- Self remembering as an active task leading to increased TPN activation
## Levels of Consciousness

**First state of Consciousness**:
- Sleep: lowest level, waking sleep, easily controlled by external stimuli, little free will
- Importance of developing free will and consciousness awareness
- Misconceptions about free will in scientific research.

**Second State of Consciousness**:
- Awareness of external stimuli
- Easily swayed by external influences

**Third State of Consciousness (Self-Consciousness)**:
- Awareness of one's own self
- In tune with body, emotions, and mind
- Not easily swayed by external stimuli
- Flashes of higher consciousness levels are possible but not permanent

**Fourth State of Consciousness (Objective Consciousness)**:
- Connection to and understanding of everything external to oneself

**Importance of Understanding Different Levels**:
- 99% of humanity is at level two or below, often unaware of higher levels
- Lack of knowledge can hinder personal growth

**Getting Out of the Mind's Way**:
- Observe external experiences carefully
- Follow feelings and sensations back to internal source
- Recognize that the mind's judgment is often flawed
- Listen, observe, absorb, and speak the language of body and emotions

**Advantages of Higher Levels of Consciousness**:
- Self-remembering as "gods or divine beings"
- Working on oneself leads to working on everything else
## Self Remembering
**Understanding Essence and Personality**
- Avoid trying to change oneself, focus on observing and understanding self
- Verification is key - take things one step at a time and verify for yourself
- Effort leads to reward

**Performing Self-Remembering**:
- Recognize that you are a collection of various parts of yourself
- Different parts may have forgotten certain memories or behaviors
- Each part has unique contributions and conflicting motives
- Constant internal struggle between different parts

**Essence vs. Personality**:
- **Essence**: The functions of your organisms (mind, heart brain, gut brain)
  - Regulates specific body processes
  - Needs to be developed for optimal functioning
- **Personality**: Everything learned through experience
  - Can dominate the essence when not kept in balance
  - Useful but can strangle the essence and prevent its development

**The Issue with the Western World**:
- Personality dominates over essence in many people, preventing essential growth
- This leads to acting childish or juvenile, as personalities are often formed during childhood

**Key Takeaways**:
- Self-remembering is about recognizing and understanding the different parts of yourself
- Balancing personality with essence is crucial for optimal functioning
## Understanding Three Centers
**Three Parts of Humanity:**
- Essence: deepest part, hard to teach people without much development
  - Developed: rare these days
- Personality: learned experiences and ingrained behaviors
  - Can be good or unhelpful
- Centers: mind, body, emotions, moving center, instinctive center, sex center

**Centers:**
- **Moving Center**: learned through experience (walking, crawling)
- **Instinctive Center**: innate and instinctual (breathing)
- **Sex Center**: neutral force between emotional and mental centers
  - Animals share lower three centers

**Understanding Actions:**
1. Follow thought or experience to source
2. Label it: moving, instinctive, or mental center
3. Example: habit of checking phone (moving center)
4. Suffering: important concept in self-remembering
5. Causes of suffering: internal dysfunctions
6. Follow root of suffering to source for deep introspection
7. Intellectually honest with yourself, but difficult to be impartial.
## Enneagram: A Tool for Exploring Personal Lack & Core Anxieties

**The Enneagram System for Shadow Work**

**Background:**
- The Enneagram is a tool used for diagnosing personal shadows
- Everyone's shadow is different due to various experiences and traumas
- Awareness of self helps in all cases, but understanding your unique pattern is essential

**Benefits of the Enneagram:**
- Reveals your particular delusion about a fundamental lack as a person
- Helps spot imbalances between personality and essence
- Integrates shadow in a more holistic way
- Useful in tandem with other tools like Myers Briggs

**Enneagram Types:**
- **Body types**: feel physically weak, unsafe, or incompetent (8, 9, 1)
- **Heart types**: feel unlovable for some reason (2, 3, 4)
- **Head types**: experience a cerebral sense of insecurity and feel stupid (5, 6, 7)

**Structure of the Enneagram:**
- Types represent different places within the psyche where one can feel a sense of lack
- Each core anxiety has three possible reaction types: confront directly, externalize, or transmute

**Other Aspects of the Enneagram:**
- Instinctual variants (self-preservation vs. sexual and social)
- Originate from childhood wounds and coping mechanisms to deal with alienation from the world.

**Integrating Types: Understanding On Your Graham**

**The Concept of On Your Graham**
- Used to identify individual development levels based on dysfunctions
- Mapping out the dysfunctions, not core strengths
- Becomes more balanced as you progress towards highest levels of health

**Embarrassment and Identification with Type**
- Some people proud, others ashamed
- Don't get overly identified with your type

**Levels of Health and Development**
- Each type has different levels of health
- Highest levels: Types start to blend together as dysfunctions smooth out

**Delusion and Real Lack**
- Core flaw may be a delusion, but it creates a real lack
- Fours example: Unlovable delusion creates moral integrity issue

**Path of Growth and Disintegration**
- Arrows represent strategies to cope with core flaws
- Growth path points towards healthier functions
- Disintegration path reverts back to previous coping mechanisms

**Polarities in Relationships**
- Wife: from people pleaser to individualistic (two to one)
- Mom: from self-centered to caring for others (four to two)

**Shadow Projection and Dynamic between Types**
- Ones project their shadow onto fours
- Fours do the same with twos

**Historical Perspective and Analysis**
- Intriguing to study through history, e.g., Sufi's Gurdjieff and Spin Cki relationship

**Human Evolution and On Your Graham**
- Nine layers representing historical evolution of human self and ego development.
## Ego Development and Internal Monologue Evolution

**Three Principles of Human Being: Body, Soul, Spirit**
- **Body**: Physical principles
- **Mind (Thoughts)**: Three corresponding principles: bioelectric fields, morphogenetics, spirit or language (e.g., bioelectric fields, morphogenetics, spirit, etc.)
- **Spirit/Soul**: Nine layered "cake" structure of human being

**Julian James' Bicameral Mind Theory and Axial Age**
- Prior to late bronze age: No indication of internal monologue as voice of the ego; voices in heads were ancestors or gods
- Axial age: Internal monologue being incorporated into human ego
  - McGillcrest's theory on hemispheric lateralization and Heidegger's distinction between Fort Hodenheit (present at hand) and Zu Hodenheit (ready at hand):
    - **Fort Hodenheit**: Present at hand, part of life world, transparent
    - **Zu Hodenheit**: Ready at hand, unworlded, abstracted in consciousness
  - Human ego developing by taking in extra layers (incorporating internal monologue) while individualizing over time.

**Bronze Age Collapse to Renaissance:**
- Ego individuality became more contracted over time
- Sense of self became abstract, akin to Platonic form
- Eventually led to "I think therefore I am"
- Descartes identified self as subjectivity, not just consciousness

**Effects of Contracting Ego:**
- Greater sense of alienation
- Leaning towards left brain direction for control and mastery

**Abstraction and Concrete Thinking:**
- Remote communities have limited abstraction abilities
- Humans have higher percentage of inhibitory neurons, allowing deeper abstraction
- Over-abstraction can lead to disconnection from reality

**Assessing Personality Types:**
- Paid tests with professionals for accurate results
- Free online tests and cross-referencing recommended
- Understanding all subtypes and balances important

**Different Ways of Perceiving Experiences:**
- Cultures may describe similar phenomena differently due to language
- No single perception is "wrong," but merging information leads to understanding same reality.
