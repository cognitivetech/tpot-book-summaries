## Introduction

**Theories of Mind: Ross Ashby's Introduction**

**Background:**
- Human brain as an immense biocomputer, larger than any artificial computer in the 1960s
- Complexities and advanced construction make comparison to modern computers challenging

**Assumptions about the Brain:**
1. **Computational Capabilities**: Large memory storage, control over outputs, complex behaviors like speech and language
2. **Built-in Programs**: Feeding, eating, sex, avoidance and approach programs
3. **Program Variability**: Some programs are evanescent while others remain permanent for decades
4. **Lifelong Learning**: Acquiring new habits throughout life; difficulty may increase with age
5. **Child Development:** Acquisition of programs like pronunciation patterns can be challenging to change later
6. **Genetically Determined Programs:** Some inherited genetic programs activate at specific times, such as Mongoloid phenomenon
7. **Environment's Role**: Special environments necessary for optimal development and avoiding negative influences
8. **Genetic Bounds:** Upper and lower performance bounds set by inherited genetic code
9. **Research Focus**: Erasability, modifiability, and creatability of programs

**Assumptions about Research:**
- Uncertainty regarding erasing programs
- Modifications with varying degrees of success possible
- Major research interest lies in finding metaprograms to control, change or create basic human computer programs.

#### Understanding Human Computation: Brain, Mind, and Metaprogramming

**Human Computer Concepts:**
- Difficulty recognizing new programs: variation on existing ones, provisional satisfaction (metaprograms)
- General purpose properties: ability to tackle various problems with little delay in reprogramming
- Self and others metaprogramming: conscious selfmetaprogramming, subconscious selfprogramming
- Mind as sum of all programs and metaprograms: includes unconscious and instinctual processes (software)
- Brain defined as visible structures within human computer (hardware)
- Theoretical inclusion of extra entity, if needed: religion, spirit, soul (not covered in this frame)
- Chemical substances with programmatic or metaprogrammatic effects: change operations of computer.

**General Purpose Properties:**
- Human computer can handle complex problems in various areas with ease
- Rapid reprogramming ability between activities

**Stored Programs:**
- Set instructions placed in memory storage system controlling the computer when activated
- Activator can be another system or external situation

**Self and Others Metaprogramming:**
- Human computer has selfmetaprogramming properties, with limits yet to be determined
- Each computer has some level of ability to metaprogram others (but not self)

**Redefining Human Endeavor:**
- Mind defined as the sum total of all programs and metaprograms (including unconscious)
- Brain and mind are interconnected, no need for mind-brain dichotomy.

**Third Entity:**
- Theoretical inclusion if needed: religion, spirit, soul (not covered in this frame)
- Existence theorem not yet satisfied regarding this third entity.

**Chemical Substances:**
- Some substances change computer operations at programmatic level and metaprogrammatic level
- Terms like "psychopharmacologically active drugs," "psychotomimetics," etc., used without therapeutic or moral connotations.

#### Exploration of Consciousness and Metaprogramming

**Theory of Self-Metaprogramming: An Introduction to a New Approach**

**Metaprogram-Attenuating Substances:**
- Useful term for ethyl alcohol and other substances affecting the mindbraincomputer
- Proposed theory may be useful in various fields, including psychopharmacology, neurophysiology, biochemistry, and psychology

**Understanding the Theory**
- Not intended to be dogmatic
- Language is close to basic English for openness and specificity
- As the theory develops, a symbolic language may emerge to simplify arguments
- Common "machine language" of mammalian brains yet to be discovered

**Self-Metaprogramming:**
- Reveals aspects of mindbraincomputer operations through subjective experience and consciousness states
- Evocation from storage can lead to new awareness and knowledge

**Modifying Programs:**
- Desired attenuations, corrections, additions, and creations possible within limits
- Unmodifiable halflives for certain programs may appear when faced with antithetical metaprograms

**Expanding Conscious Awareness:**
- New areas of consciousness beyond current comprehension
- Personal growth through courage, fortitude, and perseverance
- Hidden knowledge may be discovered after mature contemplative analysis

**Priority Lists and Metaprograms:**
- Important programs identified for revision
- Detailed understanding of nonverbal learning programs in Pavlovian and Skinnerian conditioning

**Reward-Punishment Spectrum:**
- Critical aspect of human computer operations
- Emotional underpinnings of movement toward and away must be considered
- Powerful effects on priority hierarchies of basic operational programs.

#### Exploration of Consciousness Expansion Through Larger Brain Structures and Competitive Programming.

**New Approach to Computer Programming: The Principle of Competing Uses of Limited Resources**

**Background:**
- New view and approach to computer programming based on planned "spontaneities" graded by order of occurrence
- Proper program priorities can be set at the beginning of a computer's life history
- Maintenance of general purpose properties from early human years to adulthood is worthwhile metaprogram

**Motivational Aspects:**
- Positive (pleasure producing) and negative (pain or fear producing) aspects of programs and metaprograms strike at the roots of motivational energies for the computer
- LSD 25 state can give an overall positive motivational aspect to the individual, facilitating program modifications
- Seeking pleasure as a goal itself can be facilitated by this principle

**Competing Uses of Limited Resources:**
- Human brain circuitry is limited; holding and displaying accepted reality while programming another state is difficult
- Special conditions (physical isolation, minimal stimulation) give the fullest experiences of internal explorations
- Profound physical isolation can facilitate new states of consciousness development by minimizing demands for calculating current reality programs

**Limitations:**
- Inhibiting hallucinations in young children is necessary to avoid danger from ignoring inputs from physical reality

**Computer Size and Capabilities:**
- Larger computers have more metaprograms and programs storable, and can operate more of them simultaneously
- The larger the computer, the greater its abilities to deal with current reality and reinvoke past stored programs

**Consciousness Program:**
- Expandable and contractible within certain limits
- In coma state, consciousness is nearly inoperative; in ordinary awareness, it requires a fair fraction of machinery
- Expanded states of consciousness require more of the total computer for operation

**Classification Systems:**
- Major systems of metaprograms and programs competing for resources can be categorized differently depending on the observer's metaprograms
- Classification systems include: visual, acoustic, proprioceptive, emotive, inhibitory, excitatory, disinhibitory, motor, reflexive, learned, appetitive, pleasurable, painful; oral, anal, genital, defensive, sublimated, conscious, unconscious, libidinal, aggressive, repressive, substitutive, resistive, tactical, strategic, successful, unsuccessful, passive, feminine, active, masculine, pleasure, pain, regressive, progressive, fixated, ego, id, superego, ego ideal; animal, humanistic, moral, ethical, financial, social, altruistic, professional, free, wealthy, poor, progressive, conservative, liberal, religious, powerful, weak, political, medical, legal, economical, national, local, engineering, scientific, mathematical, educational, humanistic, childlike, adolescent, mature, wise, foolish, superficial, deep, profound, thorough.

### Use of Projection Display Techniques in Deep Self Analysis with Lysergic Acid Diethylamide (LSD 25)

**Use of Projection Display Techniques in Deep Self Analysis with Lysergic Acid Diethylamide (LSD)**

**Summary of LSD's Effects on the Self-Metaprogram:**
- Changes computer operations, allowing for:
  - Creation of special states of consciousness
  - Shorter delays in executing instructions
  - Production of displays of data patterns, instructions, or storage contents
  - Variation of motivational signs and intensities
  - Replay of past experiences
- Stored experiences and programs vary in positive/negative affect

**Advantages of LSD for Self Analysis:**
- Control over programming and visual projection
- Dramatic presentation to one's self
- Unachievable outside of the use of LSD

**Use of Visually Projected Images during LSD State:**
- Mirror for body inspection induces special state of consciousness
- Stored images appear in place of body image
- Manipulation, manipulation within limits, or free association context
- Projections maintain for 30 minutes, then fatigue and rest required

**Revealing Unconscious Areas:**
- Absence of consciously desired projections reveals taboo areas
- Detailed and complete unconscious elaborations shown as projections
- Screen memories appear and disappear

**Defensive Mechanisms:**
- Flickering images phenomena: rapid rate, can't recognize significance
- Melting or distortion maneuver: not under control of self when it exists

**Affect and Modulation:**
- Current affect immediately shown on facial expression of projection despite lack of change in objective face
- Conflicts projected through switching between emotions, orders, persons, ideals

**Profound Fatigue:**
- Shows aged or diseased splotchy images when one's defenses prevent certain contents from reaching the display mechanism.

**Alternate Routes for Displaying Material:**
- Project material onto someone else's face or body instead of one's own
- Real person can serve as external reality screen and may invoke new programs, abolishing projection phenomenon in visual display.

**Therapeutic Benefits:**
- Realizing that unconscious "display" operates below awareness during human relations can lead to therapeutic self-analysis.

### Projection Screens

**Corporeal Face Phenomenon**
- Projection of own body parts onto "monstrous being" face: shoulders -> top of head, mammalian areolae -> oculi, navel -> nares, pubes -> mouth
- Can be made frightening or happy with proper programming
- Generated from childhood phantasies about bodies, male and female, threatening/seductive

**Blank Screen**
- External reality screens for LSD state projection program: nonselfreal persons, motion pictures, still pictures, self images, mirror image of face/body, eyes open or closed blank screen
- Blank screen most difficult to work with but least "driving" of the group
- Interferes least with creative efforts, takes more circuitry to create aspects from other screens
- Can be used for crossmodel synesthetic projection: music can drive content by association
- External reality program may usurp circuitry and take over from projection program with known and valued persons' pictures or voices
- Initial experiments with random noise as acoustically lighted blank screen for crossmodel excitation

**Zero Level External Reality**
- Sufficient progress with external reality projection screens allows deeper direct penetration into unconscious
- More circuitry freed up from external excitation programs to devote to internal cognitive reality analysis
- Projection "program" used in a different way in maximally attenuated environment (92-95°F isothermal skin, saltwater suspension, zero light levels, near zero sound levels, without clothes, isolation)
- Addition of LSD25 allows seeing all previous experiences with external screens as evasions of deeper self penetration.

### DEFINITION OF EVASION OF ANALYSIS OF METAPROGRAMS

**Defining Evasion in Analyzing Metaprograms**
- Evasion refers to avoiding, hiding, or distorting deeper programs/metaprograms due to their seductive, threatening, or chaotic nature.
- Fear of inner unknowns is the root fear during profound isolation situation.
- Converting motivational sign of experienced emotion from negative to positive requires discipline and self-discipline.
- Evasions into pleasure can be a major goal but must be avoided for further progress in self-analysis.

**External Reality Screens as Defensive Maneuvers**
- Useful steps during self-analysis process.
- Avoid visualizing or experiencing deepest fears.
- Risks include hedonistic withdrawal and seductive pleasure seeking.

**Comparison between Classical Psychoanalysis and Solitudinous Self-Analysis**
- External analyst present provides quick feedback, but also distractions.
- Incorporating self-analysis metaprograms from external analyst aids in independent analysis.

**Profound Isolation and LSD 25 Analysis**
- Computers use external reality for transformations and projections of data.
- Failure to project occurs when fears of underlying awareness are too great.
- Once fears analyzed, proceed to next stage of self-analysis.

---

#### Inner Perception Spaces: Filling Thought and Feeling into Projection Systems

**Inner Cognition Space**

**Overview:**
- Projection analysis moves from outer to internal systems
- Lack of external stimulation leads to self-generated activity in perception systems
- Self interprets inner excitation as external sources

**Experience of Inner Reality:**
- Subjective reality generated by personal assumptions
- Visualization: immersed in darkness, three dimensions
- Hearing sphere: silence giving way to new space
- Body image fluctuates based on fear or need
- Progress measured by ability to avoid projecting external reality data or absence of it

**Phenomena beyond Perception:**
- Thought and feeling take over perception spaces
- Expansion of self into the universe, boundaries disappear
- Infinity involved, center still remains at one place but extends infinitely outward
- Transformation of mental state to be experienced directly

**Evasions of Realization:**
- Imagination of traveling through real universe or communicating with other beings
- Basic beliefs determine what is experienced
- Ordinary perception spaces filled with cognition and conation processes.

---

#### LSD Experimentation: Philosophical and Scientific Implications

**Clarifying Factors Preventing Experiencing Phenomena**
- Fears of developing phenomena can hinder their development
- Clinical psychiatric explanations and judgments about these phenomena should be neutralized
- Assumption that experiencing phenomena may lead to irreversible psychosis is not proven
- Professionals' fear may prevent further analysis of these phenomena
- Insight into mental processes and self-discipline are at stake

**Clinical Psychiatric Judgments Sphere**
- Analyzing clinical psychiatric judgments in trained subjects before proceeding
- Importance of moving philosophically and scientifically to see utility in these experiences
- Candidly consider risks, such as potential brain and mind injury from LSD use

**Issues Surrounding LSD Use**
- Pro group focuses on spectacular results using LSD
- Con group claims loss of insight and hedonistic overvaluing of effects
- No scientific or experimental answers regarding potential damage or benefits

**Turning Point in LSD Debate**
- Controversy hinges on whether one loses insight and initiative by experiencing these phenomena
- This question should be addressed scientifically and experimentally.

### PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS

**Self-Analysis and LSD 25 Use:**

**Preparation**:
- Perform self-analysis in physical reality without LSD 25 for several exposures
- Learn to tolerate and like the experience for several hours at a time
- Attenuate and analyze fears of unconscious programming
- Training sessions with LSD 25 should be done before profound physical isolation and solitude
- Doses range from 100 micrograms minimum to tolerated maximum
- Face fears of LSD 25 itself, brain damage, mind damage, hedonistic pleasure, and control mechanisms

**Physical Isolation**:
- Acquire confidence in body's automatic functioning
- Encourage automatic operations of systems (respiration, heart action)
- Encourage release of unanalyzed negative phenomena through analytic sessions with an external analyst

**Self-Analysis Deepening:**
- Face deepest state of isolation and assumptions about self
- Studying dissolution of conscious self by death of body
- Testing existence theorem for spiritual and psychic entities
- Analyzing denial mechanisms from classical psychoanalysis

**General Purpose Self-Metaprogram**:
- Essential features: make the computer general purpose, no forbidden metaprograms or displays
- Recapture a greater range of phenomena beyond imagined limits
- Overcome evasions and needs in areas like universe, beings not human, thought transference, etc.
- Honest self-analysis to avoid childish baggage and prevent analysis dissolvers.

## 2. Summary of Experiments in SelfMetaprogramming with LSD 25

**Summary of Experiments in SelfMetaprogramming with LSD 25**

**Experimental Design**:
- Series of experiments designed and carried out in the LSD 25 state, physical isolation, and solitude
- Aimed to test validity of basic assumptions in the human computer theory
- Experiments focused on achieving high levels of belief in non-scientific assumptions

**Experiments**:
- Conducted over a period of several years
- Subjects combined LSD 25 state and physical isolation state for experimentation
- Minimum time between experiments was 30 days, maximum was several months

**Basic Belief No. 1**:
- Assumes the subject's body and brain can operate comfortably without attention in isolation
- Allows other existence metaprograms to be experimented upon safely
- Successful in sixteen experiments for leaving the body and ignoring bodily functions

**Basic Belief No. 2**:
- Subject sought beings other than himself, not human, in whom they existed and controlled them and other humans
- Experienced new universes with great variety of beings, some greater, equal, or lesser than self
- Felt as a "mere mote" in the control of these greater beings
- Dichotomized evil and good beings, had near misses and fatal accidents with the evil ones
- Good beings thought good thoughts to the subject, were at least conceivably human and humane
- Some of these beings were programming humans in the long term

**Experiment Limitations**:
- Description is sparse and compressed, does not include personal aspects or difficulties encountered
- Not intended to complicate the account with details beyond the author's aim of validity

---

#### Exploring Inner Universes and Personal Belief Systems through Self-Analysis Experiments

**Basic Belief No. 1:**
- Discoveries controlled by beings (nuclear energy, LSD, RNA, DNA) under probability control
- Humans tested and cared for by different groups of these beings
- Some beings have programs that include our survival and progress, while others oppose these programs and aim to demise as a species

**Basic Belief No. 2:**
- Subject interpreted evil beings as willing to sacrifice us in their experiments
- Limited choices available to us as a species, like an ant colony in their laboratory

**Basic Belief No. 3:**
- Assumed existence of beings controlling humans with continuous control over every aspect of our lives (no free will or freedom)
- Incorporated various models within self: parents, siblings, offspring, teachers, wife, etc.
- Battles took place between these models during experiment
- Gradually incorporated more of them into the selfmetaprogram

**Basic Belief No. 4:**
- Discovered that beings outside self were also those within
- Projected as cognitive carnivores attempting to eat up his selfmetaprogram
- Progress in controlling projection metaprogram resulted from other universes experiments
- Understood need for phantasied other universes and was able to penetrate into innermost cognitive spaces

**Basic Belief No. 5:**
- Experiments on movements of self through spacetime revealed goal realization in future and memory evocation in past
- Subject experienced sperm-egg explosion during exploration of past
- Improved skepticism about subjective judgments and continued critical skepticism necessary for a scientist exploring these areas

**Metaprogrammatic Results:**
- Formalistic view of the origins of mathematics and thinking as one suprametaprogrammatic assumption
- Fluidity and plasticity of the computer has certain limits, enlarged by experiments but continued critical skepticism necessary.

---

#### Exploring Personal Biases in Computer Experiments and Metaphysical Beliefs

**Experiments and Metaprogramming:**
- Conducted with specific beliefs in mind, assuming objective validity of experiences (not just formal)
- Results interpreted based on assumed set of rules
- Two epistemological positions: modern scientists vs those interested in religious aspect of existence
  - Scientists' position for defining truth, understanding, acceptance among peers, internal security
  - Alternative assumptions may bring anxiety and fear
- Formalistic view: computer generates all phenomena experienced, an acceptable assumption of modern science
- Ontological and epistemological position: unknown whether nonbiocomputer interventions or only happenings within the computer have occurred.

**Metatheoretical Positions:**
- Scientists' assumptions dictated by considerations other than impartiality, objectivity, dispassionate view
- Fear of consequences and anxiety can drive assumptions as defenses (emotional involvement)
- Importance of remaining philosophic and objective in this field
- Necessity to train ourselves to be dispassionate and accept both assumptions and results without fear or panic.

**Experience Phenomena:**
- Some individuals find communication with other beings through these experiments
- Childlike needs for beliefs dictate their own metaprograms, can lead to alternative existence theorems
- Evidence for unaccepted assumptions must be presented by those who have attenuated their childish needs before being examined dispassionately.

## 3. Personal Metaprogrammatic Language

**Personal Metaprogrammatic Language and Its Properties:**

**Components of Personal Metaprogrammatic Language:**
- Used for controlling metaprograms at various levels in the biocomputer
- Unique to each individual
- Not all shared publicly
- Can be nonverbal, emotional, mathematical, or linguistic

**Experiment on Private Control Instruction (Key is no key):**
- Subject became aware of carrying many keys for locks in external reality
- Burdened by the physical and mental burden of keys
- Visualized inner rooms with antithetical metaprograms and searched for keys to open doors
- Saw defined boundaries as a convenient metaprogram dividing knowledge and control mechanisms
- Rooms contained personal ideas, systems of thinking evoking fear or anger
- Difficult to define out of existence due to intense emotional attachment

**Approaches to Solving Problems:**
1. Frantic and frightened search for keys
2. Mathematical transformations as topological puzzles
3. Turning rooms inside out through locks, leaving contents outside for use by selfmetaprogrammer
4. Movement of energies and masses of data from supraselfmetaprogram to selfmetaprogrammatic level
5. Opening up layers of childhood supraselfmetaprograms
6. Knowledge that programmatic materials had been moved from supraselfposition to underselfcontrolled position at the programmatic level.

---

#### Exploring Metaprogramming: Interdimensional Mind Transformations

**The Key is No Key Experiment**
- Subject experimented with unlocking doors in real life
- Noticed that external reality couldn't be controlled by self-metaprogram
- Recognized limitations of self-control over external reality
- Retained certain rules for conduct in external reality
- Metaphorically, "the key is no key" represents private self-metaprogramming language phrase
- Should not be applied to other human biocomputers without consideration
- Exploration necessary to understand own body image and emotional regions
- Topological transformations can result in metaprogram changes
- Bias, prejudice, preconceptions are supraselfmeta-programs that hinder change
- Control over metaprograms achieved through exploration of ndimensional spaces and finding key points for transformations.

**Linguistic Symbolization of Mathematical Operations**
- Linguistic symbols offer shorthand to human computer
- "The key is no key" represents complex operations in adult symbolized form
- Human computer limited by acquired mathematical conceptual machinery
- Maximum control over metaprograms achieved through exploration and finding critical turnover points.

**Geometrical Model of Operations**
- Three-dimensional geometrical model used for understanding complex metaprogram interactions
- Membranes with varying colors, pressures, and shapes fill a large room
- Points of contact between membranes are not as fixed as initially perceived
- Light sources within certain sheets shine through others; hue and intensity vary by local rules.

**Microcircuitry Within Membrane**
- Intersections contain micromolecularatomic switch lines, switch surfaces, and switch points
- Collisions occur between membranes involving various particles (electrons, mesons, protons, neutrons, neutrinos) in multiple directions.

---

#### Exploring Inner Reality Beyond Physical Boundaries with Flexible Thinking.

**The Computer as a Metaphor**
- The phrase "T/7e key is no key" has evolved into a new understanding of a computer
- This computer recognizes no locks, restrictions, or boundaries within itself
- However, there are still boundaries outside the computer that must be considered
- Boundaries outside the computer include both physical and non-physical influences

**The Unknown Region Beyond the Computer's Boundaries**
- The unknown region beyond the computer's boundaries is a source of skepticism and doubt
- This region contains goals worth exploring, but requires preparation to do so
- To explore the unknown, one must:
  - Recognize its existence
  - Minimize conceptual baggage and remain open-minded

**The Need for Deep Exploration of the Inner Unknown Region**
- To explore the inner unknown region in depth, we need the best thinking capabilities available
- We must dissolve or reprogram doctrinaire and ideological approaches to this area
- Remaining skeptical of formalized approaches is desirable, but not to the point of allowing others to control the computer
- Deep interlock between selected human computers is needed for this exploration
- Conceptualization of the thinking machine itself is required by the best minds available

## 4. Metaprogramming in the Presence of a Fixed Neurological Program (Migraine): Example of Perception and   Belief Interactions

**Migraine Case Study: Metaprogramming and Perception**

**Background:**
- Subject's belief in presence of others not at stake
- Asymmetries of spatial perception fields (right vs left)
  - Color differences, persistence of afterimages, scotoma during migraine attack
- Distortions of visual system
  - Right eye more sensitive, lower threshold for pain and photophobia
  - Stronger sensations on right side of head
  - Migraine confined to the right side of head

**LSD25 State:**
- Programs exist below consciousness or created de novo
- Perception differences enhanced during LSD25 state
- Unconscious programs evoked, including traumatic experiences from childhood
- Distorted perceptual field causes projection of "aliens" or presences
  - Need for relief from solitude and isolation
- Beliefs used in constructing and modifying external reality
  - Difficulty programming projections without LSD25 state
- Unconscious programming often used to project beliefs onto others

**Challenges:**
- Detection of distorted perceptual space without LSD25 state
- Overcoming interlocking feedback relations between self and important persons in the environment
- Self-assumptions about sources of information in solitude during LSD25 state: inside one's own head, from other beings or humans, or from outer space intelligences/ESP.

**Implications:**
- Understanding the role of unconscious programming and beliefs in shaping perception
- The importance of self-awareness and detection of distorted perceptual fields without LSD25 state
- Difficulty in examining these processes when roles are accepted by others and feedback is maintained.

## 5. Note on the Potentially Lethal Aspects of Certain Unconscious, Protohuman, Survival Programs

**Potentially Lethal Aspects of Certain Unconscious Programs**
- Some aspects of certain programs have the ability to destroy the individual biocomputer or lead to destructive action
- A metaprogram is needed to neutralize programs with self-destruction

**Use of LSD in Self-Analysis**
- Quick penetration into buried lethality through LSD use, but caution advised
- Personal professional supervision before, during, and after sessions recommended for several days
- Some survival programs (protohuman) may appear during analysis

**Survival Programs (Protohuman)**
- Strong expressions of sexuality, gluttony, panic, anger, overwhelming guilt, sadomasochistic actions and phantasies, and superstitions
- Powerful over the self metaprogram
- Much of this material is wordless and exists in emotional/motivational storage parts of the computer
- LSD allows breakdown of emotional/motivational systems and modeling/clear thinking systems
- If strong enough, the modeling system can receive powerful currents of emotion and construct a new operating model
- If not strong enough, the modeling system may be overwhelmed by protohuman survival programs
- Additional caution in use of these substances: self-programmer must be strong enough to experience these phenomena and avoid mistakes or errors in reprogramming/commitments

**Recommendations for Use of Methods**
- Recommended for most experienced and strongest personalities with the right training
- Control short-term and long-term welfare, actions, speech, and transactions between persons present.

## 6. Choice of Attending Persons During LSD 25 State Used for SelfAnalysis

**Importance of Attending Persons During LSD-25 State for Self-Analysis**

**Mistakes by Attending Person**:
- Can have devastating power
- Must be scrupulously avoided

**Qualifications of Attending Person**:
- **Mature, experienced, previously-exposed persons** should be allowed in the ER during this critical time
- Ideal: Been through LSD-25 self-analysis with professional psychoanalytic training and isolation/solitude
- Minimum: High-quality professional psychoanalytic training or careful selection of attending supervisors by professionals
- Exclusion test must be done to evaluate potential attendant/therapist:
  - Personally experienced several LSD-25 sessions with self-analysis metaprograms
  - Penetrated beyond buried lethality and hostility
  - Professional selector thoroughly acquainted with the potential aide and evaluated their progress

**Special Cases**:
- Some spouses/lovers have special understanding and interlocks, allowing certain kinds of deep penetrations, elicitations, and reprogrammings
- If one member has LSD-25 self-analysis training, they can help the other as a standby monitor and positive love object, but should have professional psychoanalytic control
- Controls can vary from tactical/strategic advisory sessions to ER supervisory, depending on egostrength and current development stage of each member

## 7. Behavioral, NonIsolation Replay of Protohuman Programs: The Problem of Repetitive Unconscious Replay. Certain kinds of programs in the human comput

**Behavioral Non-Isolation Replay of Protohuman Programs: The Problem of Repetitive Unconscious Replay**

**Circular Programs**:
- Certain programs in the human computer (below ordinary levels of awareness) are circular
- Can be useful and needed, or misused (e.g., in maintaining disparate and disturbing programs)
- Example: Patient's program "Mother has abandoned baby... Daddy loves me and hurts me and leaves..."

**Repetitive Replay**:
- The patient was a baby when this important reality program became fixed, circular, and carried into adulthood
- This program operates slowly or rapidly, and continuously in the adult
- In the external reality (e.r.), the real situation cannot halt the circular program
- The circular program is used to facilitate playback and maintain the strength of this old model program
- Any important person in the e.r. must be made to fit into this "ancient model" program

**LSD Effect**:
- LSD reduces the relative strength of the e.r. program by enhancing other programs
- It can increase the strength and activate basic models in storage
- Allows self-metaprogramming orders to be carried out
- Strong circular programs are likely replayed
- The self observer participates in the replay, but is programmed as relatively weak with respect to the replay program
- External observer sees a dramatic, repeat performance of the unhappy pattern again and again

**Progress Towards Positivity**:
- With proper e.r., personnel, and responses from them, progress leads the circle gradually out of negative feelings into good ones
- The fear and other negative emotions are stripped off the circular program
- Good feelings are attached to replay
- The self can examine the newly charged positive structure for reduction in importance and filing as a relic of childhood
- This leads to feeling free, cleaned out, with increased strength and energy

**Feedback Control Relations**:
- Each part of each level has feedback control relations with each part
- Feedback connections between levels: Level Vl through IX to X (e.g., "These programs are necessary for survival...")

## 8. Basic Effects of LSD 25 on the Biocomputer: Noise as the Basic Energy for Projection Techniques.

**LSD Effects and Biocomputer Analysis**

**Hypothesis:** LSD effects can be explained by introducing white noise into specific systems in the human brain computer.

**Impact of White Noise:**
- Random access to memories with lower threshold (expansion of consciousness)
- Projection of expectations onto external stimuli (God, thoughts from others)
- Creative use of noise for information creation
- Limited destruction of order, only enough for new interpretations

**Principle of Projection:**
- Human computer creates signals out of noise
- Noise can be used to display thinking and feeling instead of sensory projections

**Growth Hypothesis:**
1. LSD may impact CNS growth patterns, particularly those that become active during the LSD state.
2. Optimal concentration for these effects is needed; below that there's only irritation.
3. At optimal concentration, new CNS growth occurs (nontolerant state).

#### Exploration of LSD-Induced Metaprogramming and Its Effects on the Central Nervous System

**Phases of Metaprogramming with LSD-25**

**Phase 1: Infantile State**
- Analogous to young human mind's state, possibly beginning in fetus or embryo

**Phase 2: Prolongation of Optimal Concentration**
- Additional material can be administered and prolonged within certain limits
- Prolongation achieved until tolerance develops with optimal concentration

**Phase 3: Tolerance Development**
- Thought to be the completion of fast new growth in central nervous system (CNS) and autonomic nervous system

**Phase 4: Slow Growth Continuation**
- If optimal concentration is maintained for hours or days, growth may continue slowly

**Phase 5: Stress Syndrome**
- At concentrations above optimal, a "stress syndrome" occurs (adrenalvascular, G.I. tract, etc.)
- Separate from affective results of LSD25 state in certain individuals causing stress syndrome

**Phase 6: Reversal of Beneficial Effects at High Concentrations**
- Antigrowth factors are stimulated, homeostasis assured in organism
- Negative programming during LSD25 experience can reverse growth (self-programmer, unconscious metaprograms, or outside therapist)

**Phase 7: Autonomic Nervous System Growth**
- Growth not confined to central nervous system; autonomic nervous system may also grow

**Theory and Results for Metaprogramming with LSD25:**
1. Facilitates positive systems in CNS (reward, positive reinforcement) through LSD25
2. Inhibits negative systems in CNS (punishment, negative reinforcement)
3. Adds noise at all levels, decreasing thresholds and increasing programmability
4. Strengthens programs below usual levels of awareness
5. Increases suggestibility for metaprogramming by self and external sources
6. Continuous positive state results in increased positive reinforcement: a) Self b) Thinking c) Introduced thinking d) Others e) Environment f) Complex input patterns
7. Effects fall off slowly over 2-6 weeks, with residual effects up to one year after exposure
8. Repeated weekly or biweekly exposures for several months (years) maintain positive reinforcements until usual state returns.

## 10. Coalitions Interlock and Responsibility

**Coalitions: Interlock and Responsibility**

**Von Foerster's Coalition Theory**
- Increasing survival times of larger aggregates called coalitions (matter, cells, organisms)
- Mammalian cells in humans may be most numerous on earth with longest current survival time
- Coaltions form through bonds that reduce negentropy below sum of unlinked entities
- Coalition appears more than sum of isolated parts due to unique linkages and rules at each level

**Types of Coalitions**
- Atom/molecule: electric charges, well-known coalitional rules (opposite attracts, like repels)
- Biological cell: meiosis, mitosis, fission, fusion, positive and negative tropisms, ingestion, excretion
- Intracellular vs. extracellular relationships: feedback, interconnections through chemical, physical means

**Human Coalitions**
- Interhuman coalition in present versus modeled past coalitions
- Vigorous current e.r. interlock leads to information exchange and projection of expectations/predictions
- Isolated individual projects past models and makes new relationships to settle discrepancies between old and new ones

**Polarity of Coalition Forces**
- Basic particle/atomic level: electric charges, rules (opposite attracts, like repels)
- Biological cell level: multifaceted possibilities (meiosis, mitosis, etc.)
- Intraorganismic cell: essential coalitions, myriad linkages, well-fed and well-cared for slave of the organism.

#### Complexity of Human Relationships and Responsibility Across Multiple Levels

**Human Organism Coalitions and Responsibility:**
* Parental: till death, internal models
* Malefemale: continuous, marriage coalition
* Financial (money): income and outgo, multiple consents for control
* Children: demanding coalitions with offspring
* Unconscious: below awareness, phantasied linkages, contracts may not incorporate unconscious commitments/desires

**Factors of Any Human Coalition:**
* Circular feedback
* Distance rules
* Positive (attractive) and negative (repulsive) motives
* Excitation and inhibition rules and limits
* Coalition field agreements

**Human Coalition Field:**
* Dynamic, growing
* Formed in a coalition field surrounded by other coalitions
* Connectivity: multiple and complex
* Freed bond energy from broken coalitions used to form new ones or strengthen existing ones

**Types of Human Coalition Bond Energies:**
* Attractive: maintain a viable coalition by exciting and inhibiting links within limits
* Repulsive: maintain coalition by adjusting two pushes and pulls involved (doublebind, G. Bateson)

**Individual Responsibility:**
* Starts with self and body coalitions
* Continues with human-human, interspecies, concepts of self, communication with innermost realities
* Requires strong autonomous character for effective functioning in society
* Smooth mind function may require strong measures, handling

## 11. Participant Interlock, Coalitions  with Individuals of Another Species

**Interspecies Communication with Dolphins: Human's Role in Understanding**

**Background:**
- Author's struggle to understand interspecies communication between humans and dolphins
- Lack of adequate theory for human portion of the network, making progress difficult
- Scientific community has shown little interest due to human superiority beliefs

**Characteristics of Human Brain**
- Large size and complexity compared to other computers
- Stored programs and metaprograms present
- Verbal forms for programming influenced by native language and nonverbal elements
- Scales of self-measurement and evaluation
- Comparison scales set up between biocomputers

**Computer Interlock**
- Mutual model construction and operation facilitated by interlock functions
- Maximum intensity, complexity, and speed of reprogramming achievable in solitude
- Two methods of data collection and analysis: controlled system (current basis) and participant observer (intimate experiential interaction with natural elements)

**Retreats from Interlock Research:**
- Scientists retreat into beliefs that limit research on dolphins to a specific philosophical system
- Evasion through fear or experimental "mucking around" without interlock research
- Pretending to be nonexistent observers, i.e., ethological approach, which also evades interlock research effectively.

#### Interspecies Communication with Dolphins: Mimicry and Metaprograms.

**Cognitive Traffic Control Devices to Evade Responsibilities of Close Contact with Dolphins**
- **Icthyologists, zoologists, comparative psychologists, anthropologists, ethologists, astronomers** have each approached dolphins, proposing reasons for not continuing interlock research and devoting resources to it.
- **Non-scientist type persons** also approach with similar sophistries.
- A few stay due to a sense of wonder, awe, reverence, curiosity, or intuitive feel for the dolphins. These are the potential interlock group sought.
- Dedication to dolphin-human interlock without evasions is a difficult new profession. The few who stay need help: facilities, assistance, privacy, few demands, money, cognitive and intellectual backup, encouragement, enlightened discussions, and, of course, dolphins. This is currently a necessarily lonely profession.

**Metaprograms for Interspecies Interlock**
- Models of human and nonhuman communication based on logical, linguistic, and computer grounds lack experience with interlock research between species other than humans.
- The "participant theorist" approach: the theorist establishes an interlock with a nonhuman computer by whatever modes are possible, programs themselves with open hypotheses to encourage communication, and the resulting interactions set up new metaprograms that drive the interaction.
- Observations of Tursiops truncatus (dolphin) interlock: a large daily commitment is necessary for the human end, order of 16-20 hours/day for 11 weeks to achieve complex communication via nonverbal and verbal channels. Conscious-unconscious reciprocal models develop within the limits inherent in each participant.
- Initial phase consumes most of the initial 1,000 hours: consciousness-unconsciousness aspect is important; hostility-fear can lead to ritualistic, evasive interlock. At the dolphin end, selection of individuals for interlock may be "hit or miss," with no unconscious hostility or fear programs in the human's people's computers. Older dolphins less likely to participate due to survival exigencies requiring cooperation and interlock within their species.

#### Communication with Dolphins: Mutual Mimicry and Self-Programming

**Dolphin Communication Theory**

**Mimicry as a Program for Demonstrating Communication**:
- In the airborne vocal and hearing channel, humans mimic dolphin signals to show their program and metaprogram
- This leads to mimicry of human swimming patterns by dolphins when humans mimic theirs
- Mimicry is a mechanism for measuring the adequacy of human-dolphin interlock functioning
- Similar to a child's word mimicry before learning to use words

**Plea for Further Research**:
- Develop a theory of human communicator facing non-human communicator with high quality brain and presumed mind
- Theory should include: open-ended, nonspecific, general purpose, self-programming, mutual respect, voluntary dedication
- Proper participant selection, support, interest from scientific community, cooperation from open-minded professionals required.

## 12. Summary of Logic Used in this Paper: Truth, Falsity, Probability, Metaprograms and Their Bounds

**Logic Used in This Paper: Truth, Falsity, Probability, Metaprograms and Their Bounds**

**Four-Value Logic:**
- Two traditional values: true and false
- Two additional values: as if true (asterisk before true) and as if false (asterisk before false)

**External Reality vs. Internal Reality:**
- External reality: observable, checkable, uses "true" and "false" without quotes
- Internal reality: subjective beliefs, uses values in quotation marks: "true", "false", "as if true", "as if false"

**Metaprograms:**
- Define as true or false a given metaprogram based on internal judgment (survival)
- Less intense metaprograms defined as "as if true" or "as if false"
- Values can be modified with probability scale: 1.0 (absolutely certain), gradation to O (improbable), 1 (impossible) for all logic categories.

**Coalitions:**
- Function like internal judgments, define certain things as "true" within limits
- Human law and consensus wisdom follow this logic system

**Imperatives:**
- Some metaprograms have imperative, externally proven truth/falsity relationship
- Cannot be manipulated without danger to existence, function as superselfmetaprograms
- Determined biological necessities: obtaining food, sexual activities, responding to pain and fear.

**Programs for Survival:**
- Regulating physiological limits: temperature, liquid/solids, pressures, radiation, particles, gases
- Interactions with other species and information regulation
- Phenomena like "information overload" or "information deprivation" exist.

**LSD State:**
- During LSD state, certain programs must be considered as true in order to survive.

## 13. Hardware, Software Relationships in the Human Biocomputer

**Assumptions for Investigating Central Nervous System Relationships:**
1. Simplifying assumptions:
   - Approximately 10^10 neurons in central nervous system (CNS) connected in specific ways
   - Critical event is firing of impulse into axon
   - External control and pickup of impulses
   - High-speed computer records all impulses
   - Storage for every second: 10^14 impulses
2. Reproducing stored patterns:
   - External computer reproduces time pattern of impulses over 10^10 channels
   - Behavioral test hypothesis: identical behavior during reproduction if neural impulses are controlling
3. Recording and comparing behaviors:
   - Record external behavior (color, motion pictures, multiple channel tape)
   - Store neuronal signs of activity during complex behavior production
   - Playback stored patterns in the same sequence and compare with original behavior
4. Longer time patterns may be needed for feedback control systems
5. Questions that can be answered: physical events related to phoneme, semantic levels, metaprogramming, language programming
6. Meaningful drug effect evaluations on central nervous system
7. Systems analysis of limbic system, positively and negatively reinforcing systems, control of pituitary, feedback relationships between various CNS systems.
8. Objectives: quantitative analysis of physical aspects of subjective events outside the CNS, controlling functions of a second CNS.
9. Detailed proposal in Chapter 14.

## 14. Problems

**Program Levels and Brain Activity Analysis**

**1. Human Biocomputer: Biophysical Analysis and Control of Brain Activity**
- **Program Level**: More than just relations, includes neuron connections and storage of signs
  - **Connection to every CNS neuron (10^10 array)**
    - Hypothesis: First connection picks up firing sign (action potential)
    - Second connection furnishes electrical pulse for neuron firing
  - Storing signs in huge computer by time and place of occurrence over half hour (1800 sec., 1.8 x 10^9 microsec.)
- **Behavior Analysis**: Record total behavior during half hour interval (2.1)
  - Replay behavior at later time through connections (3.1)

**Questions:**
I. Does step replay record, store, or reproduce behavior?
II. What is the subjective experience during connection usage?
III. Is there memory of stored signs after replay?
IV. Are stored signs and behavior sequences remembered as separate events?
V. Do psychophysical tests during replay yield identical results to those during original interval? (Word test programmed on tapes with step distortions below detection threshold)
VI. What else needs to be stored or controlled apart from neuron firing signals (a-f)?
  - Membrane potential of each cell
  - Variations in membrane potential over dendritic tree
  - Local concentrations of serotonin, norepinephrine, etc.
  - Previous firing history for chosen half hour period
  - Blood levels of critical substances
  - Glial activities and substance concentrations
IIX. Does detailed control of neuron firing introduce molecular signal storage as an independent controller?
IX. Does this system give control over program level, metaprogram level, self-metaprogram, and supraself-metaprogram?
  - Absolute or relative control over these levels
X. Can such a detailed neuron firing control function as an absolute supraself-metaprogram?

## 15. Metaprogramming the Body Image

**Metaprogramming the Body Image**

**Personal Body Image Metaprograms**:
- Posture, walking stance, sitting patterns, lying down patterns, and body posture during sleep
- Interdigitates with acquired muscular skills (e.g., writing, running, sports)
- Interdigitates with use of the body during emotional states (e.g., angry outbursts, sexual activities, fright and flight patterns)
- Self-metaprogram feeds back on itself through external body image in mirror and proprioceptive/muscle tension feedback

**Investigating Proprioceptive and Muscle Tension Aspects**:
- Exercises to increase range of motion at specific joints
- Discovering joint capsules, muscles, and other tissues have limits that attenuate joint range
- Particularly true for spinal, pelvic, rib cage, thoracic spine, cervical spine, limb joints
- Daily repeated reprogramming exercises can modify entrenched programs

**LSD State**:
- Positive system excitation and reinforcement of new patterns during exercises
- Attenuation of negative system activity, allowing greater muscle/joint stretching
- Ability to contract muscles more fully
- Caution against straining muscles, joints, ligaments, and tendons

**Detecting SuperSelfMetaprograms**:
- Negative metaprograms (e.g., aging, crippling) reflected in posture and pelvic movement restrictions
- Reprogramming requires real body to go through "forbidden" movements
- Willingness to experience fear is essential for new programming

**Cautions**:
- Possibility of narcissistic self-worshipping evasion of reprogramming in this area
- Importance of natural evolution towards ideal metaprograms to assure progress
- Energy and dedication needed, particularly in older persons
- Reducing body weight (obesity) can enhance physiological functions and increase exercise effectiveness

**Yoga Exercises**:
- Enhance lung, gut tract, musculature, joints, bones, posture
- Increase circulation of heart and blood vessels, reducing probability of coronary attacks, angina pectoris, etc.
- Large fat reservoirs (panicles adiposus) limit organ function and require increased blood pressure

## 17. Excerpts from “The Idiot“ by Fvodor Dostoyevsky+

**The Idiot by Fyodor Dostoyevsky**

**Dostoyevsky's Letter to Nikolai Strakhov**:
- Describes a feeling of happiness and harmony with the world before an epileptic seizure
- Compares the experience to giving up ten years or even one's whole life for just a few moments of bliss

**Prince Leo Nikolayevich Myshkin**:
- Experiences a moment of heightened awareness and understanding during his epileptic seizures
- Sees these moments as "the highest mode of existence," but also as a departure from the normal condition
- Paradoxically, sees these moments as both beauty and prayer, worth the whole of life

**Self-Metaprogramming**:
- Dostoyevsky's experiences can be explained through the concept of self-metaprogramming in the human brain
- Self-metaprograms operate between the large storage system and external reality
- Stored programs and metaprograms are essential for understanding mental operations and resulting behaviors like speech and language

**Altered States and Substances**:
- The effects of certain substances on the brain can be explained by this theory, such as LSD and examination of stored programs and reprogramming

**Automatic Unperceived Programs**:
- In the child, automatic metaprograms can be controlling for later adult thinking and behavior
- Energy can be transferred from these automatic unperceived programs to the self-metaprogram with special techniques and central states

**Examples of Self-Analysis and Self-Metaprogramming**:
- Methods, investigations, and results in self-analysis and self-metaprogramming are provided.
