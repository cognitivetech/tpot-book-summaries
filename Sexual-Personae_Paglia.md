# Sexual Personae: Art and Decadence from Nefertiti to Emily Dickinson
by Camille Paglia 

> The fiery, provocative, and unparalleled work of feminist art criticism that launched the exceptional career of one of our most important public intellectuals—"a remarkable book, at once outrageous and compelling, fanatical and brilliant.... One must be awed by [Paglia's] vast energy, erudition and wit" (The Washington Post).
> 
> Is Emily Dickinson “the female Sade”? Is Donatello’s David a bit of pedophile pornography? What is the secret kinship between Byron and Elvis Presley, between Medusa and Madonna? How do liberals and feminists—as well as conservatives—fatally misread human nature? This audacious and omnivorously learned work of guerrilla scholarship offers nothing less than a unified-field theory of Western culture, high and low, since Egyptians invented beauty—making a persuasive case for all art as a pagan battleground between male and female, form and chaos, civilization and daemonic nature. - [Sexual Personae (Amazon)](https://www.amazon.com/Sexual-Personae-Decadence-Nefertiti-Dickinson/dp/0679735798//?&tag=cognitivetech-20)

### Chapter 1 Sex and Violence, or Nature and Art

**Nature vs. Society**
- **Nature**: supreme moral problem, source of human life's subordination
- Human beings not nature's favorites, indiscriminately affected by natural disasters
- Inherent cruelty and aggression in humans (will-to-power)

**Society**
- Artificial construction to reduce passivity towards nature
- Social reform as means for paradise on earth

**Rousseauism**
- Rejects original sin, exalts innate goodness of man and social environmentalism
- Dominant ethic in American human services, penal codes, and behaviorist therapies

**Feminism**
- Simplifies sex problem as a matter of social convention
- Seeks political equality for women but rejects contingency and human limitations by nature or fate
- Sexual freedom leads to sadomasochism

**Theory**
- Perfect freedom is to die by earth, air, water, and fire
- Taboo surrounds sex regardless of culture due to its primal urges
- Eroticism, a realm where morality falls away.

#### "The Daemonic Nature of Sex and Human Identity: A Journey Through Family Romance and the Chthonian"

**Integration of Body and Mind**
- Recreational sex or expansion of women's rights won't solve the problem
- Incarnation, limitation of mind by matter, is an outrage to imagination
- Gender is an imposed reality that people carry throughout life
- Physicality is a source of torment; body is the "tree of nature" on which we are "crucified"

**Daemonic Nature of Sex and Emotion**
- Freud's unconscious is a "daemonic realm"
- At night, we descend to the dream world where nature reigns
- Every encounter, clash or submission to authority bears traces of family romance
- Falling in love is irrational, symbolic, and representation of vanished realities
- Sexual scripts are learned, while consciousness is entangled with animal instincts
- Western culture cannot have purely physical or anxiety-free sexual encounters
- Compulsion and ancient Necessity rule; search for freedom through sex is doomed to failure

**Western vs. Eastern Approaches**
- Western science and intellect seek to control and understand nature, while Far East seeks harmony with it
- Western culture focuses on perceptual relations and named objects, while Eastern culture complies with nature's rules
- Aesthetic judgment of nature as "beautiful" is a defense mechanism against the daemonic realities beneath the surface.

#### "The Western Construction of Tragedy: A Male Narrative of Rise and Fall"

**The Tragic Sense of Life**

**Modern Humanists**:
- Defined the "tragic sense of life" as the touchstone of mature understanding
- Saw man's mortality and transience of time as literature's supreme subjects
- This was an evasion and sentimentality, a partial response to experience

**The Tragic Sense of Life**:
- The tragic sense of life is a partial response to experience
- It is a reflex of the west's resistance to and misapprehension of nature
- Compounded by the errors of liberalism, which followed Wordsworth's Romantic nature philosophy rather than Coleridge's daemonic perspective
- Tragedy is the most western literary genre, did not appear in Japan until the late 19th century
- The protagonist's destruction recalls the slaughter of animals and real human beings in archaic ritual

**Tragic Sense vs. Reality**:
- Life is not a tragedy but a comedy
- Comedy is born of the clash between Apollo and Dionysus, nature pulling the rug out from under pompous ideals
- Female tragic protagonists are rare, tragedy is a male paradigm of rise and fall
- Tragedy plays a male game, testing and purifying the male will

**Challenges in Assessing Greek Tragedy**:
- Loss of 3/4 of the original body of work
- Lack of survival of complete satyr-plays, the finale to classic trilogy
- Modern criticism projects a Victorian, Protestant high seriousness on pagan culture
- Paradoxically, assent to chthonian realities leads to humor, not gloom

**The Chthonian Drama**:
- Consciousness is a pitiful hostage of its flesh-envelope
- Free will is stillborn in the red cells of our body
- Tragedy's inhospitality to woman stems from nature's inhospitality to man
- The identification of woman with nature was universal in prehistory, but has been forgotten by modern feminists

**Femaleness and Cultural Strength**:
- Cultic femaleness is no guarantee of cultural strength or viability
- What survived, what vanquished circumstance, was Mycenaean warrior culture descending through Homer

#### "The Female Body and the Cycles of Nature: A Historical Perspective"

**The Male Will-to-Power and the Evolution of Religion**

**Apollonian Athens and Transcendental Traditions**:
- The fusion of Mycenaeans from the south and Dorians from the north formed Apollonian Athens, which gave rise to Greco-Roman western history
- Both Apollonian and Judeo-Christian traditions are transcendental, seeking to surmount or transcend nature

**The Dionysian Element**:
- Despite Greek culture's contrary Dionysian element, high classicism was an Apollonian achievement
- Judaism, Christianity's parent sect, is the most powerful protest against nature

**Woman in Early Religion and Sky-Cult**:
- Woman was a central figure in earth-cult, as the model for Great Mother figures
- The shift from earth-cult to sky-cult moved woman into the nether realm
- Sky-cult is an advanced stage in the history of religion, shifting creative locus from earth to sky

**The Identification of Woman with Nature**:
- The identification of woman with nature is a troubled and troubling term
- All genres of philosophy, science, art, athletics, and politics were invented by men
- Women have the right to seize and vie on their own terms, but must also wrestle with nature's cycles

**The Male Formulation of History**:
- The western idea of history as a propulsive movement into the future is a male formulation
- Woman, bound to nature's calendar, cannot refuse her appointment
- Western woman has an agonistic relation to her own body, with menstrual cycle viewed as a disease

#### "The Chthonian Nature of Womanhood: Menstruation, Mythology, and the Femme Fatale"

**Nature and Women's Biology**
- Nature cares only for species, not individuals
- Women experience monthly hormonal changes that can lead to "edema" (swelling) and menstruation
- Pregnancy demonstrates the deterministic nature of woman's sexuality
- Pregnant women may feel their body and self taken over by a chthonian force beyond their control

**Menstrual Blood and the Chthonian Matrix**
- Menstrual blood, including uterine shreds and placental jellyfish, represents a connection to our evolutionary origins in water
- Revulsion from slime is a deep-seated human response to our biological origins
- The premenstrual woman may be manifesting latent perversity from the reptilian brain
- Pregnant women are "daemonically complete" and need nothing/no one as an ontological entity

**Feminism and Archetypes of Woman**
- Feminist arguments that female archetypes were falsehoods by men have a rational basis due to disgust at the grossness of procreative nature
- The Apollonian (reason, logic) vs. Dionysian (chthonian, procreative) dynamic has shaped western personality and achievement
- Western culture distorts reality but also pushes human higher cortical powers to great heights
- The femme fatale archetype represents the uncontrollable nearness of nature in mythology

#### "The Persistence and Power of the Femme Fatale: A Psychological and Cultural Examination"

**The Femme Fatale as a Sexual Persona**

**Demystification of the Femme Fatale by Feminism**:
- Dismisses the femme fatale as a cartoon and libel
- Sees her as a victim of society, resorting to destructive womanly wiles due to lack of political power
- Views the femme fatale as a career woman manquée, with energies neurotically diverted into the boudoir

**Limitations of Feminist Demystification**:
- Sexuality is a murky realm of contradiction and ambivalence
- Cannot be fully understood by social models like feminism, which is an heir of 19th century utilitarianism
- Mystification will always remain the disorderly companion of love and art

**The Fascination of Eroticism and the Femme Fatale**:
- **Eroticism**: A mystique that cannot be "fixed" by codes of social or moral convenience
- **The femme fatale**: A mesmerizing sexual persona, not a fiction but an extrapolation of biologic realities in women
- Represents a daemonic instability in sexual relations that must be accepted

**The Femme Fatale as a Refinement of Female Narcissism**:
- Represents the ambivalent self-directedness completed by the birth of a child or conversion of spouse/lover into child
- Mothers can be fatal to their sons, who erect politics and sky-cult to evade this

**The Dangers of the Femme Fatale**:
- She has an amoral affectlessness, a serene indifference to the suffering of others, which she invites and observes as tests of her power
- Her remaining is a daemonic burden that can smother history

**The Shift from Chthonian to Aesthetic Sense**:
- The aesthetic sense is a displacement from one area of reality (chthonian) to another (aesthetic)
- Analogous to the shift from earth-cult to sky-cult

#### "The Eye, the Animal, and the Chthonian: Uncovering the Biological and Psychological Roots of Human Perception and Desire"

**Ferenczi's Perspective on Human Eye and Animal Nose:**
- Ferenczi speaks of human eye replacing animal nose due to upright stance
- Eye is peremptory in its judgments, decides what to see and why
- Each glance is exclusion as much as inclusion
- We select, editorialize, enhance our ideas of beauty

**Human Desire:**
- Consciousness has made humans all "cowards"
- Repression is an evolutionary adaptation for functioning under expanded consciousness
- Desire is besieged by anxiety and doubt
- Beauty drugs us and allows action
- Beauty is a revision of chthonian nature

**Sexuality:**
- Sexual necessity drives humans back to "bloody scene" of procreation
- Female genitals are symbolic wound, menstruation and childbirth affront to beauty
- Excretion can be saved by comedy; menstruation and childbirth cannot
- Woman's historical status as sex object is a compromise with dangerous allure

**Male Domination in Art, Science, Politics:**
- Based on analogy between sexual physiology and aesthetics
- Men are anatomically destined to be projectors
- Destiny may be a curse for men

**Sexual Biography and Sexual Geography:**
- What breaks into consciousness shaped by sexual biography and geography
- Mind is captive of the body, perfect objectivity does not exist.

#### "The Gender Divide: Understanding Emotion and Reason Through Male and Female Perspectives"

**Exhaustion and Psychic Supersaturation**
- In exhaustion, western man shuts out psychic supersaturation
- Number, the crystalline mathematic of Apollonian purity, was invented as a refuge from emotionalism and disorder
- Women excel in mathematics within a system devised by men for mastering nature

**Emotion vs. Number**
- Number is the most imposing and least creaturely pacifier, man's yearning hope for objectivity
- Flight from emotion to number is another strategy of the Apollonian west in its long struggle with Dionysus
- Emotion is chaos; passion, a continuum of eroticism and aggression
- Love and hate are not opposites, only differ in quantity, not kind
- The Christian code of love is an impossible and unnatural ideal

**Mother-Love/Mother-Hate**
- Chthonian superflux of emotion is a male problem
- Political equality for women will make little difference in emotional turmoil
- Only saints can sustain the Christian code of love, requiring exclusion of reality

**Man's Cultural Achievements**
- Man's singular anatomy gives rise to basic metaphors of apprehension that vary greatly between sexes
- No equality in sexual compartmentalization and genital concentration/projection
- Male sexuality is inherently manic-depressive, driven beyond self and body

**Sexual Concentration and Projection**
- Man's sexual concentration is an instrument for overcoming emotional energy
- Through concentration to projection into the beyond, man makes a voyage to nonbeing and back
- The male projection of erection and ejaculation is paradigmatic for cultural conceptualization.

#### "The Male Gaze: Sex, Power, and Metaphors of Concentration and Projection"

**The Difference Between Male and Female Sexuality**

**Male Conceptualization and Sexual Mania**:
- Men's sexual practices, such as fetishism and pornography, are symbol-making and conceptualizing activities
- Men's sexual acts are acts of imagination and require them to assert their authority
- Male sexual success is transient and can lead to feelings of humiliation

**Male Bonding and Projection**:
- Male bonding is a self-preservation society, with men forming larger groups for reassurance
- Men's genital urination is a form of commentary and can be aggressive
- Male dogs mark their territory as a form of graffiti art

**Female Physiology and Limitations**:
- Females are earthbound and have limited physiological capabilities compared to males
- Women's access to facilities during events is often inadequate, while men can easily use them

**The Disjunction Between the Sexes**:
- The sexual attraction and repulsion between the sexes will always be present
- Androgyny, as a blend of male and female qualities, belongs to the contemplative life rather than the active

**Woman's Metaphor: Mystery**

- Women's sexuality is veiled and mysterious, as they cannot see their own bodies as males can
- The invisibility of the womb leads women to accept limited knowledge as a natural condition
- Violent removal of this veil may be a motive in violent crimes against women

#### "The Archetypal Nature of Sexual Violence: A Cultural Exploration"

**Sex Crimes: The Daemonic Nature of Human Sexuality**

**Sex Crimes**:
- Always male, never female
- Conceptualizing assaults on the unreachable omnipotence of woman and nature

**Woman's Body as a Sacred Space**:
- Contains an archaic night where all knowing must stop
- Erotic dancing (striptease) is a sacred dance of pagan origins
- Nude woman carries the "chthonian darkness" from which we come
- Woman's body is a "secret, sacred space" and a "ritual precinct" (temenos)

**Female Body vs. Male Body**:
- **Virginity**: Male quests for experience, penis as extension of self; Female is a sealed vessel to be broken into by force
- The female body is the prototype of all sacred spaces from cave shrines to temples and churches
- Womb is the "veiled Holy of Holies", a great problem for sexual polemicists

**Taboo on Woman's Body**:
- Taboo that always hovers over the place of magic
- **Woman is literally the occult, which means 'the hidden'**
- Political equality will succeed only in political terms, not against the archetypal

**Rape as a Sexual Expression**:
- Rape is male power fighting female power
- Not merely violence but also sexual expression of the will-to-power
- Society is woman's protection against rape, not the cause

**Nature's Role in Sexual Violence**:
- Profanation and violation are part of nature's daemonic law
- Rape is a development in degree of intensity of basic sexual movements
- **The commonest violence in the world is childbirth**, with its pain and gore

**Feminism and the Limits of Liberal Theories**:
- Feminism misses the blood-lust, joy of violation, and dark fantasies in rape
- Pornography shows nature's daemonic heart and interpenetrates art
- Christianity has never Christianized the pagan evil magic of sex

**The Survival of Paganism**:
- **Paganism has survived in the thousand forms of sex, art, and now the modern media**
- Historiography's error was asserting that Judeo-Christianity defeated paganism

#### "The Dual Nature of Sex and Religion: A Comparative Analysis of Paganism and Christianity"

**Christianity and Paganism**
- Christianity has absorbed opposition, including during the Italian Renaissance
- Facing serious challenge with rebirth of gods in popular culture and mass media
- Judeo-Christianity's latent paganism burst forth again in modern times
- True paganism not unbridled sexual licentiousness; recognized and honored nature's daemonism
- Christianity tried to suppress nature, focusing on transcendental other world
- Sexual contact with nature limited by Christian institutions like monasticism and marriage

**Sex and Violence in Media**
- Mass media responds directly to popular patronage
- Sidesteps liberal censors controlling book culture
- Contemplation of pagan myths and sexual stereotypes through film, music, and commercials
- Sexual tension: male aggression vs. female manipulation
- Prostitution as rebuke to moralistic views on sex; amoral power struggle

**Male and Female Sexuality**
- Male satyriasis (promiscuity) sharpens thought, contrasts with female nesting (infrequent sexuality)
- Biological basis for double standard: male aggression and lust essential for survival in a predominantly female world
- Serious men have more partners than assumed; women protect identity through restraint
- Female purity important for fetal development, as reservoir of still water
- Masculinity fights effeminacy daily; climax of male success marked by woman's dominance and reabsorption.

#### "The Masculine Quest for Identity in the Face of Feminine Nature"

**The Relationship Between Sex and Art in Western Culture**

**Sexual Man**:
- Operations of sex are convulsive: intercourse, menstruation, childbirth
- Involves overcoming resistance in the body or beloved
- Repetition-compulsion: male writes "commentary" on his phallic projections and needs to be rewritten again
- Masculine curse of needing something/someone to complete oneself

**Projection**:
- Male's need for art to imitate woman's self-containment
- Art is the closest man has come to imitating this
- Blocked artist suffers like Leonardo, "suffers tortures of the damned"

**Mona Lisa and Ambiguous Smile**:
- Records woman's self-satisfied apartness, ambiguous mocking smile at male vanity/despair
- Everything great in western culture came from the quarrel with nature

**Nature vs. Apollonianism**:
- Nature is "blooming and withering", a "festering hornet's nest of aggression and overkill"
- Apollonianism is a "sublime refusal" of the "dehumanizing magnitude of female nature"
- The artist creates a "shutting in" or "binding" to tame the "daemonic energy" of nature

**Art as Ritualistic Reordering**:
- Art, no matter how minimalist, is never simply design but a "ritualistic reordering of reality"
- Inspired by anxiety to "shut out" the flux of nature
- Contemplation is a "magic act", and art is "order" not necessarily "just, kind, or beautiful"

**The Artist's Motivations**:
- The artist makes art not to save humankind but to save himself
- Every benevolent remark by an artist is a "fog to cover the bloody trail of his assault against reality and others"
- Art is sacrificial, turning its inherent aggression against the artist and representation

#### "The Apollonian and Dionysian in Art, Culture, and Personality"

**Dionysus vs. Apollo:**
- **Dionysus**: associated with liquids, identified with chthonian fluidity (blood, sap, milk, wine)
- **Apollo**: gives form and shape, marks off one being from another, associated with thing-making

**Artifacts and Human Experience:**
- All artifacts are Apollonian
- Melting and union (Dionysian) vs. separation and individuation (Apollonian)
- Every boy leaving his mother to become a man is turning the Apollonian against the Dionysian
- Every artist needs to create to overcome chthonian nature

**Sexual Experience:**
- Men must mediate between Apollo and Dionysus in sex
- Women can remain oblique, opaque, taking pleasure without tumult or conflict
- Genitally, man has a "thing" he must keep dipping in Dionysian dissolution (risky business)
- Male focus, concentration, and projection are tools of sexual survival
- Objectification is conceptualization, the highest human faculty

**Art and Western Civilization:**
- Attempts to repress Apollonian thing-making have been defeated
- Christianity tried to make spirituality primary but ended up reinforcing western ego-structure
- The hero of medieval Church militant (knight in shining armor) is the most perfect Apollonian thing in world history
- Art books need to be rewritten, with a direct line from Greek/Roman sculpture to Renaissance classicism

**Cinema and the Western Eye:**
- Cinema is the supreme Apollonian genre, thing-making and thing-created
- The movie projector is an Apollonian straight-shooter, demonstrating the link between aggression and art
- Every pictorial framing is a ritual limitation, a barred precinct
- Standards of beauty are conceptualizations projected by each culture, telling us everything

**The Power of the Eye in Western Culture:**
- The western eye is a projectile into the beyond, blazing lightbeam of Apollonian transcendence
- The west makes personality and history numinous objects of contemplation, with the 20th century as the Age of Hollywood.

#### "The Pagan Western Eye: Sex, Power, and the Idolatry of Images in Modern Culture"

**The Pagan Cult of Personality and Western Culture**

**Pagansim in Modern Art and Thought**:
- The pagan cult of personality has reawakened and dominates all art, thought
- It is morally empty but ritually profound
- We worship it through the power of the western eye
- Movie screens and television are its sacred precincts
- Western culture has a roving eye
- Male sex is hunting and scanning: boys harass girls, men whistle at women

**The Feminine and Eros**:
- The feminine is the ultimate symbol of human desire
- It recedes beyond our grasp, leading to a dream of being freed from sex
- Sex, knowledge, and power are deeply tangled
- Islam wisely drapes women in black to protect them from the eye

**Judeo-Christianity vs. Pagansim**:
- Judeo-Christianity has failed to control the pagan western eye
- Our thought processes were formed in Greece and inherited by Rome's Catholic church
- Intellectual inquiry and logic are pagan, preceded by a roving eye that cannot be morally controlled
- Judaism put a taboo on visual representation, while Christianity drifted into pictorialism to appeal to the pagan masses

**The Pagan Elements of Catholicism**:
- Protestantism began as an iconoclasm, breaking the images of the corrupt Roman church
- The pure Protestant style is a bare white church with plain windows
- Italian Catholicism retains the most florid pictorialism, the bequest of a pagan past that was never lost

**The Dangers of Word-Worship**:
- Traditional genre criticism is moribund
- Academics are constantly fighting a rearguard action against mass media
- The humanities must abandon their insular fiefdoms and begin thinking in terms of imagination, crossing the genres and uniting high with popular art

**Pornography as Pagan Imagism**:
- Pornography is pure pagan imagism, a ritual expression of chthonian nature
- It attempts to get the whole picture of the enormity of sex and nature, despite its limitations

#### "The Dark Allure of Art and Pornography: A Contemplation on Human Nature and the Daemonic Theater of Perception"

**Art as Contemplation and Crime:**
- Art is a form of contemplation and conceptualization, making order out of primal mysteries
- Pornography reveals the violence and ugliness in nature's cyclical brutality
- Voyeurism in art isolates the sensational element present in all human experience

**The Connection Between Art and Pornography:**
- Both inseparable as they explore voyeurism and voracity
- Pornography is a protest against the violations of freedom by nature
- Cannot be banned but driven underground, enhancing its illicit charge

**The Role of Apollonian Objectification:**
- Western perception objectifies things into idols
- Artwork and personalities are visible ideas or persona
- Tension between hard personalities and the continuity of nature leads to decadence and sadomasochism

**Capitalism and Western Aesthetics:**
- Capitalism's gaudy greediness is inherent in western aesthetics since ancient Egypt
- Objectifies persons and personalizes objects, creating a market for Apollonian corrections of nature.

#### "The Apollonian and Dionysian Aspects of Capitalism: A Feminist Perspective"

**Brand Names and Western Identity:**
- Brand names are expressions of western identity (Apollonian formalism)
- Shiny chrome automobiles, grocery boxes, and cans represent hard, impermeable personality
- Capitalism and art have a parallel nature: both amoral and acquisitive, hostile to competitors
- Art works and capitalist products are similar in their role as expressions of western culture

**Capitalism as an Art Form:**
- Capitalist distribution network is a complex chain of factories, transportation, warehouses, and retail outlets
- A lightning-quick Apollonian circuit of male bonding
- Feminists' disdain for patriarchal society overlooks the benefits it has provided, including leisure time and freedoms for women
- Male achievements in civilization: paved roads, indoor plumbing, washing machines, eyeglasses, antibiotics, disposable diapers, fresh food supply chains, bridges, construction, and cranes

**Dichotomy between Sex and Power:**
- Feminist dichotomy between sex and power is unsupportable
- Nature's true face revealed during crisis: she is not controlled by Jehovah or human beings; it is an All Devils’ Day
- Western love has always been ambivalent, with a magnetics of eroticism due to the hardness of western personality
- Modern pursuit of self-realization through sexual happiness is misguided; freedom is overrated and society is necessary for individuality.

### Chapter 2 The Birth of the Western Eye

**The Birth of the Western Eye**

**Mythology and Cosmogony**:
- Mythology begins with cosmogony, the creation of the world
- Matter divides into objects and beings, creating order
- Western art is rooted in male-dominated Judeo-Christian cosmogony
- God creates nature, with consciousness preceding and engulfing all

**Genesis and the Male Declaration of Independence**:
- Genesis rigid and unjust, but gave man hope as a man
- Genesis remade the world by male dynasty, cancelling the power of mothers
- Jehovah exists outside creation, beyond space and time

**Egyptian Cosmogony and Fertility Gods**:
- Egyptian Khepera gives birth to the second stage of existence through masturbation
- Uroboros: the serpent eating its own tail, a model for Romantic creativity
- Egyptian gods are tangled in archaic family romance, with identity regressive and supercondensed

**Judaism and the Rejection of Art**:
- Judaism is inhospitable to art in man, though acknowledging God's artfulness
- Earth-cult's lurid sexual symbolism contains a psychic truth about creation's sexual element

**Romanticism and the Restoration of Archaic Myths**:
- Romantic poetry is filled with incest, erotic solipsism, and masturbation
- Khepera as an androgyne demiurge represents the fertility god archetype
- The Great Mother embodied the gigantism and unknowability of primeval nature

**The Myth of Matriarchy**:
- No evidence supports the existence of a matriarchal society in any culture
- Feminist writing on this idea began with Bachofen in the 19th century, revived by American feminism

#### "The Great Mother: Goddess of Fertility and Transformation"

or

"Matriarchy, Mother Goddesses, and Rituals of Transformation"

**Primitive Life and Matriarchy:**
* Lack of peace, protection from superior strength provided by men
* Polarization of sex roles: men roamed and hunted while women gathered near campsite with infants

- It is the hieratic signature of the western will
- Leonardo's high classical mind wanted to subdue mother nature, but in depicting her, he allowed her to dictate his style

**Michelangelo's Endless Anxiety and Renewed Labor**:
- To the end of his life, Michelangelo leapt from labor to labor, piling up his stunning achievement
- His bequest is the most brilliant series of Apollonian images since Athens' revival of Egypt's royal glamour

**The Iconic "David" Statue**:
- A true kouros, a sinewy boy-man
- Glares toward Goliath along a plane of the aggressive western eye
- Contrasts with Donatello's charmer "David" as a teenaged athlete
- Overwhelms the pilgrim viewer by its blazing solar radiation and defiant domination of space
- Fends us off, an idealization of male physical perfection

**Michelangelo's "Moses"**:

- Old Cumaean Sibyl is a "most fantastic sexual persona" with:
  - Grim wizened features
  - Bursting breasts "as pumpkins"
  - Lumbering shoulder and arm "brawny beyond human maleness"

**Virago as Androgynous Feminine Persona**:
- Virago: Fusion of Great Mother and Amazon, without fecundity or free movement
- Large-breasted, sexually mature, body "heavy and inert"
- Spiritually imprisoned and poisoned
- Example: Jeanne Duval, Baudelaire's bisexual harlot Muse

**Michelangelo's Masculine Personae**:
- Creation of Adam (Eve) with winning femininity is made possible by suppression of her body
- Mary (Rome Pietà) is pure, tranquil with male nudes as "sublime but enervated masculinity"
- Michelangelo's life work: Epic without significant involvement of femininity

**Virago vs. Madonna Misericordia**:
- Medici Chapel nudes: Self-enclosed, paralyzed, dyspeptic
- Virago is "self-enclosed, paralyzed, and dyspeptic"
- Michelangelo's depiction of viragos as "half-male" blending masculinity and femininity

**Michelangelo's Feminine Personae: Conclusion**:
- Michelangelo invested his imaginative energies largely in masculinity
- Yet, the masculine is in constant danger of melting into the feminine
- Examples: Cumaean Sibyl and idealized portrait of Giuliano de’ Medici with "feminine glamour" and "autoerotic" chest.

#### "Exploring the Sexualized Imagery in Michelangelo's Sculptures: An Unconventional Perspective"

- Perverse combination of athletic male physique with female mood and body language
- Eroticism ignored by scholars, who focus on allegorical meanings

**Michelangelo's Sculptures**
- Beautiful youths with cruelly blank faces crushing older men (e.g., "Victory")

#### "The Apollonian Gaze: A Comparative Analysis of Chaucer and Spenser's Poetic Styles"

**Comparison Between Chaucer and Spenser**

**Chaucer**:
- Populist writer
- Accepts the flesh
- "The Canterbury Tales" has a "scratchy, rustling detail" from manuscript illumination
- Opposes absolutism and extremism

**Spenser**:
- Aristocratic in form and content
- "The Faerie Queene" is "cinematic" with long "blazing sightlines"
- Pioneering theorist of aggression, anticipating various philosophers and psychologists
- **Aggressive Eye**: The conceptualizing power behind "The Faerie Queene"'s largest ideas
- Prefigures epic sweep and probing light of film and projector
- Divided Christianity from Judaism by assimilating pagan art

**Comparison Between Apollonian and Western Art/Thought**:
- **Apollonian Line**: Originated in Egypt and Greece, passed through Donatello, Botticelli, Michelangelo, Blake, Shelley to Pre-Raphaelites and Oscar Wilde
- Spenser's work makes cinema out of western art and thought's primary principle: "to see is to know; to know is to control"
- Spenserian eye cuts, wounds, rapes as a tactic of defense that turns into perversion

**Comparison Between Eastern and Western Armor**:
- Asian art based on female curves, while western armor insists on technological insulation from nature
- Japanese Samurai armors are bristly, rotund, half-camouflaged in nature
- Western soldier is a "steely marching machine", unlike the eastern's organic shapes and bushy appearance

#### "Exploring the Interplay of Apollonian and Dionysian Themes in Spenser's The Faerie Queene"

**Western Apollonianism vs. Eastern Philosophy**
- Western Apollonianism: ungiving, impermeable, adamantine, aesthetic of closure
- Japanese philosophy: sentences trail off into thin smoke, avoiding closure
- Western armor: separatist, dividing self from nature and self from self
- Spenser's armour symbolizes Apollonian externality, strife, and solar wakefulness
- The Faerie Queene: nature lurks with seductive dissolutions of surrender and repose

**Spenser's Heroines**
- Armed Amazons Belphoebe and Britomart are potent women in literature
- Spenser removed usual archetypal basis of female force, the daemonic
- Imagined heroines as Apollonian angels, creating new Renaissance cult of married love
- Replaced romance of adultery with a "romance of marriage" in The Faerie Queene
- Marriage was utilitarian affair before Renaissance, not connected to art

**Spenser's Attraction to the Great Mother**
- Anomalous attraction to benevolent Great Mother, foreign to the Renaissance
- Always double-sexed: both male and female, sire and mother
- Exalts her in Venus’ Temple with genitalia of both sexes
- Daring, original, perhaps unsupportable recasting of sexual mythology

**Spenser's Repair of Splits in Imagination**
- Tries to turn foul cup of Whore of Babylon into a Holy Grail
- Militant instrument of Apollonian definition: chastity, self-armouring of personality
- Virtue means holding to one's visible shape in human realm

**Belphoebe and Britomart as Sexual Personae**
- Flood verse with strange golden light, analogous to Crystalline Aphrodite
- Suppress maternal silhouette, approach sexually indeterminate
- Radiance of Olympian gods identical to glamour of Hollywood publicity

#### "Gender and Representation in Renaissance Literature: The Case of Belphoebe in Spenser's 'The Faerie Queene'"

**The Faerie Queene: The Amazons and the Renaissance**

**Aristocrats of a Dark Era**:
- The camera's idealizing eye gave them Apollonian power and perfection
- The Amazons in **The Faerie Queene** shed light on their era, which was characterized by economic chaos and war

**Amazons vs. Italian Renaissance Portraits**:
- English Renaissance literature strongly departed from the Italian model
- Italian men and boys were vivacious and ravishing, while women seemed placid, stolid, even stupid
- The feminine conventions of shaved eyebrows and bulbous foreheads did not help
- Double-faced portraits like those by Piero della Francesca or Raphael showed stark contrast between the men's fully developed personalities and their wives' static and bland representation

**Lack of Respectable Women in Italian Imagination**:
- Respectable women could not pose at leisure
- The "Plotina effect": a lady confines herself to one persona, meaning expressionlessness

**Spenser and Shakespeare's Departure from the Italian Model**:
- Spenser and Shakespeare starred willful, educated women like Caterina Sforza and Isabella d'Este
- They loved imperious, volatile women, unlike the placid representations of women in Italian Renaissance art
- This departed from the Italian model, where respectable women were not the focus of imagination

**The Symbolic Liberated Woman: Belphoebe**
- Belphoebe burst into **The Faerie Queene** like a divine epiphany
- She was the "Byzantine Elizabeth," with a high classic symmetry and mass
- With her white and gold Amazonian splendor, she was like the chryselephantine colossus of Athena in the Parthenon
- Belphoebe mediated between the extremes of art and nature, masculinity and femininity
- Her name means "beautiful Diana," and she carried "deadly tooles" (her male weapons)
- She was impenetrable, like the frosty, unknowable Garbo

**The Apollonian Universe: Domination and Submission**
- The Apollonian universe of domination and submission permitted no emotional involvement
- Characters like Belphoebe were given to rather dull speeches

#### "Exploring Gender and Identity in Spenser's 'The Faerie Queene'"

**Spenser's Feminine Characters in The Faerie Queene**

**Belphoebe:**
- Eloquence belongs to evil characters, including Despair (I.ix.38–47)

- Descends from Olympian mind to human hurts with advent of pity
- Self-sequestered, not part of main action

**Britomart:**
- Central protagonist in Book III and more
- Chastity with enchanted spear, invincible knight
- Initially mistaken for a man by Arthur and Guyon
- Revealed as female in an aside
- Paragon of knightly prowess, double sexual nature: amiable grace and manly terror
- Inspires both love and fear
- Apollonian supernature, moon and sun, cold and hot
- Pushed vision into forbidden celestial space
- Contains solar beams, killing glances of omnipotent eye
- Motherless like Athena, Atalanta, and Camilla

**Britomart and Glauce:**
- Intimate maternal scene: rubbing, kissing, and comforting
- Corresponds to Rosalind and Celia's childhood union in As You Like It
- Lesbian suggestiveness: Britomart treats Amoret as her male champion

**Malecasta:**
- Jaded sophisticate and chatelaine
- Sexual aggressiveness turns things kinky
- Wanton eyes that roll too lightly, hostile western perception on the loose
- Homoerotic attraction to Britomart, despite knowing she's a woman
- Fails to accept False Florimell as her paramour. Instead, pursues Amoret in male impersonation beyond necessary.

#### "Exploring the Androgynous Sexual Personae in Spenser's 'The Faerie Queene'"

**The Faerie Queene and Britomart's Sexual Complexity**
- **Britomart**:
  - Extraordinary range of human experience, from masculine achievement to maternal generation
  - Dazzling Apollonian androgyne with an adolescent boy figure
  - Will renounce athleticism and militancy for motherhood
  - Her name is a Cretan title of the Great Mother (Britomartis) and not a fusion of "British" and "martial"
  - One of her missions is to visit Isis' shrine, where she experiences a sex change and becomes pregnant goddess
- **Spenser's Grand Plan for Britomart**:
  - To cover the full range of human experience
  - Parallels the finale of As You Like It
- **Artegall and Britomart's Relationship**:
  - Artegall initially falls short of Britomart's expectations
  - Britomart must cede sovereignty to him in marriage, even though he initially outranks her in combat
- **Artegall's Education and Transformation**:
  - Spenser describes him as a "rude strength" when first introduced
  - He needs to be tempered from his brutish masculinity to become more androgynous
  - But Artegall goes too far under Radigund's influence and becomes effeminate, emasculating himself
- **Radigund**:
  - An Amazon queen with a "strange glittering light"
  - Recalls the description of Belphoebe, but Radigund is a bully who forces captives to do women's work
- **Spenser's Sexual Personae and the Great Chain of Being**:
  - Chivalric sex roles are reversed, with Britomart as the "white knight" and Artegall the damsel in distress
  - Spenser values courage and confrontation over helpless, retiring femininity

- Avarice is imagined as rape, the sacrilegious wounding of earth's "quiet wombe"
- Rape cycle is the most advanced rhetorical structure in Renaissance poetry
- Spenser intellectualizes Ovidian motif, sees rape as metaphor for biology and surges of aggression in nature

**Sexual Dominance and Power**:
- Christian ethics assailed by pagan instinct
- Spenser senses the identity of sex and power, permeation of eroticism by aggression
- Lust is a medium to enslave other sex, personified as Lechery, Sansloy, enemies of Temperance, Lust
- Rapists are savage churls or knights who have not undergone feminizing refinement of social life
- Weakness inspires attack, nature abhors a vacuum

**Feminine Victims and Masochism**:
- Florimell and Amoret are flagrant targets for attack due to their femininity and lack of sexual complexity
- Savage circular world of rape is transcended by higher characters who internally subsume masculine and feminine extremes
- Rapists vainly strive to obliterate their opposite, leading to sadism and masochism

**Influence on Literature**:
- Spenser's naive rape victims appear in Coleridge's Christabel and Emily Dickinson's work

    * Acrasia, Circean sorceress and vampire, tempts knights into lewd sloth
    * Dionysian miasma, dissolution of Apollonian contour
    * Sexual energy flows away, weakness ensues
  - Spenser fights off female traps and delays in heroic epic

**Sexual Themes in The Faerie Queene**
- Extended meditation on sex in literature
- Charts entire erotic spectrum from matter to spirit (normal to aberrant)
- Sex must have a social goal: marriage as sanctified link between nature and society
- Perversions cataloged: rape, homosexuality, exhibitionism, incest, bestiality, necrophilia, fetishism, transvestism, and transsexualism (Krafft-Ebing's Psychopathia Sexualis)
- Sadomasochistic sexual bondage: captivity, enslavement, love as sickness or wound
- Flight from sex: fear or frigidity, narcissism, autoeroticism, stagnant psychic pool (self-love inhibits spiritual progression)
- Voyeurism: observing voluptuous sexual scenes.

**Narcissism and Autoeroticism in The Faerie Queene**
- Personality becomes a prison with dainty self-withholding and autoeroticism
- Lucifera gazes at herself in hand mirror, no energy of duality or spiritual progression (I.iv.10)
- Phaedria laughs and sings to herself, makes sweet solace to herself alone (II.vi.3).

#### "The Seductive Power of Voyeurism in Spenser's 'The Faerie Queene'"

**Themes and Analysis of Voyeurism in "The Faerie Queene" by Edmund Spenser**

**Background:**
- Poem filled with scenes of sexual transgression, voyeurism, and sensuous beauty
- Critics have analyzed its moral implications but overlooked the poet's ambivalence towards these elements

**Bower of Bliss**:
- Characters engage in lewd behavior and expose themselves to others
- Scenes include Cymochles ogling women, Guyon watching bathing lady wrestlers, Acrasia fastening "her false eyes" on Verdant

**Malbecco's Banquet**:
- Hellenore and Paridell arouse each other through brazen eye contact and lewd sexual theater
- Scene repeated in the tapestry of Venus and Adonis in Castle Joyous (III.ix, x)

**Sleeping Serena**:
- Inspected by a tribe of cannibals who seat themselves like an audience and judge her body parts

**Symbolism on Mount Acidale**:
- Hundred naked maidens dancing in a ring, symbolizing harmony of nature and art

**Criticism of Voyeurism**:
- C.S. Lewis coined the term "skeptophilia" for Spenser's Bower of Bliss but criticism did not follow up
- G. Wilson Knight called the poem "perilously near decadence," with pornographic material being the strongest and most realized
- Scholarship mistakenly identified poet's ethical voice with their own, overlooking Spenser's teasing ambiguities

**Decadent Aesthetics**:
- Formality creates perversity: Amoret's suicide scene, Mirabella's punishment, Artegall finding a headless lady
- Beauty, laughter, sex, torture, mutilation, and death combinations are emotionally startling and ethically problematic

**Christianity and Voyeurism**:
- Christianity failed to put out the pagan eye but expanded its power by creating vast tracts of forbidden territory for sexual personae to penetrate and defile.

**Conclusion**:
- "The Faerie Queene" is a massively original analysis of western cultural tensions regarding morality, taboo, and sensuality. Criticism assumed what Spenser said was his meaning, but a poet is not always master of their own poem due to the power of imagination.

**Spenser's Style:**
* Amalgamation of prurience and moralism in his work
* Linear series of epiphanas presented through tableaux
* Archaic language meant to halt changes in Renaissance personae

**Shakespeare:**
* Metamorphosist and closer to Dionysus
* Expands inner life of characters, sets them into overwhelming plots
* Elemental energy comes from nature itself.

**The Sea as a Master Image in Shakespeare's Plays:**

**Background:**
- Disguised women inspire romantic errors in many tales, influenced by Ovid's Iphis
- Stories imitate droll Ovidian manner of sexual innuendo
- As You Like It and Twelfth Night depart from their sources in avoiding bedchamber intrigue

**Rosalind vs. Viola:**
- Rosalind: brasher, arms herself with cutlass and boarspear
  - Loves directly, lacks conventional feminine tenderness
  - Dominates play's finale, asserts innate aristocratic authority
- Viola: melancholic, recessive
  - Timid, easily terrorized

**Transvestite Heroines:**
- Both choose sexually ambiguous alter egos (Cesario, Ganymede)

  - Masculinizes herself through official mission as Orsino's representative

**Male Leads:**
- Orlando: adolescent-looking, unimpressive exponent of masculinity

- Orsino: narcissistic, dubious masculinity
  - Viola represents him but also a male, further masculinizing her

**Gender and Identity:**
- Principal characters become androgynous echoes of one another
- Shakespeare reduces male authority to maximize heroine's potency

**Friendship:**
- Rosalind and Celia: amorously exclusive friendship functions as counterpoise to adult marriages.

#### "Exploring Gender and Sexuality in Shakespeare's 'As You Like It': Rosalind's Transvestite Journey"

**As You Like It: Celia and Rosalind's Relationship**

**Celia's Reluctance to Give Away the Bride (IV.i)**
- Celia is reluctant to say the words for a sham wedding ceremony with Rosalind
- Prodded three times before she can bring herself to give away the bride
- Shakespeare intends this subtext of sexual tension, as he changes the source material in Lodge's work where it was the Celia character who merrily invented and urged on the sham wedding ceremony

**The Union of Rosalind and Celia (IV.i)**
- The union of Rosalind and Celia is emotional but not overtly sexual
- Their intimacy is that female matrix found in Britomart's bond to her nurse
- As You Like It explores an early stage of primary narcissism from which the adult heterosexual commitments emerge

**Rosalind's Exogamy and Marriage (III.iv)**
- Rosalind exclaims, "But what talk we of fathers when there is such a man as Orlando?"
- Family and childhood alliances must yield to the new world of marriage
- Rosalind undergoes a process of increasing sexual differentiation and splits from Celia by psychic mitosis
- Their friendship is an all-in-all of gender, a solace for that motherlessness which Shakespeare imposes on his maidens

**Rosalind's Capacity for Bisexuality (unnoticed theme)**
- Rosalind has the capacity for bisexuality as she could go either way
- Distinctly flirtatious in her prank with Phebe, pretending to be a rakish lady-killer and becoming one
- Superb language of arrogant command flows from her when she assumes the sexual persona of Ganymede (III.v)
- A complex psychological response to erotic opportunity which she may or not consciously recognize

**Britomart's Lesbian Courtship (Spenser's Midas)**
- Britomart's actions are divorced from her thoughts, which are on her future husband
- They drift into an involuntary realm of lesbian courtship like Spenser's Britomart with Amoret
- Male disguise elicits wayward impulses from the socially repressed side of their sexual nature

**Masculinity and Femininity as Masks (II.iv)**
- Orlando must recover his manly autonomy to consummate his love for Rosalind
- Rosalind as a rose has dual sexual attributes, the phallic "love's prick" as well as the female genital "rose"
- Shakespeare seems to view masculinity and femininity as masks to put on and take off

**The Use of Virtual Boy Actors (II.iii)**
- Elizabethan theater used beardless boys, probably with wigs and some makeup, conditioning audience to a suspension of sexual disbelief
- Epilogue to As You Like It demands recognition of the theatrical transsexualism by modern female impersonators
- Male portrayal of female roles in Elizabethan theater was inherently more homoerotic than Greek or Japanese theater.

#### "Exploring Gender and Androgyny in Shakespeare's Plays and Sonnets: The Beautiful Boy and Transvestite Rosalind"

**Shakespeare's Gender Spectacles in As You Like It and Twelfth Night**

**Twelfth Night**:
- Boys playing roles of both genders would create "shimmering spectacles" of the mystery of gender
- Last act scene between Viola/Cesario (male disguised as a woman) and Orlando was a "dazzling series of impersonations"
- Director sought an "atmosphere of spiritual purity" but production was "as simple, stylized and, in fact, as cold as a Noh play"

**As You Like It**:
- London's National Theatre attempted an all-male production in 1967
- Director sought "an atmosphere of spiritual purity"
- Rosalind playing Ganymede inducing Orlando to mock-woo her was a "dazzling series of impersonations"
- Reviewer said it was "as simple, stylized and, in fact, as cold as a Noh play"

**Boys as Rosalind and Viola**:
- Roger Baker claimed boys would be "unnerving" as Rosalind and Viola because they could "act with a natural gravity and grace"
- Boys playing these roles led Greek sacred procession of the Dionysian Oschophoria, reproducing archaic ritualism and cultism of early drama

**Shakespeare's Sonnets**:
- Shakespeare's sonnets addressed two love-objects: a "baffling forceful woman" and a "beauteous and lovely youth" (fair youth)
- Fair youth was evidently highly androgynous in appearance, called an "angel," "master mistress," and had a "woman's face" and "a woman's gentle heart"
- Sonnet 20: Shakespeare called fair youth his "master mistress" and said he had "a woman's face" but was male, anticipating modern hormonal theory
- Fair youth was a hermaphrodite: facially and emotionally female but with the sexual "superfluity of a penis"

**Shakespeare vs. Marlowe**:
- Shakespeare rarely dwelled on homosexuality in plays, unlike contemporary Marlowe who constructed plays around it (e.g., Dido, Queen of Carthage)
- Shakespeare segregated by genre, diverting homosexuality into lyric and keeping it out of drama

**The Beautiful Boy**:
- Androgyne beautiful boy was an "objet d'art," brought into being by the admirer's reverent eye, but silence was a threat to drama
- Rosalind inherited the marriage obligation of the fair youth, whose refusal of social integration confined him to sonnets
- Beautiful boy in plays would seem shallow and small; Rosalind as Ganymede made the choice for others rather than self

**Shakespeare's Transvestite Comedies**:
- Addressed public issue of effeminate men and masculine women wearing men's clothes, took a liberal position on it
- Unlike Botticelli, Shakespeare never yielded to Puritan pressure; plays turned toward decadence rather than away from it in Jacobean period

#### "Shakespeare's Androgynous Protagonists: A Study of Volatility and Transformation"

**Themes of Pederasty and Androgyny in Shakespeare's Work:**
- Vergil's Mercury: woman is "various and changeable" ( Aen . IV.569–70), similar to Rosalind's description of boys being moonish due to their mercurial inconstancy.
- Adolescence was recognized for its volatility before the Enlightenment.
- Shakespeare's Rosalind speaks about rapid shifts in persona and quickness, which is reminiscent of Hermes/Mercury.

- **Air**: language, wit, balance, humane perspective
- **Water**: intuition, sympathy, deep feeling, mystical oneness, prophecy
- **Earth**: order, method, precision, realism, materialism

**Symbolism in Cleopatra's Arrival at Tarsus**:
- Her barge resembles a "burnished throne" burning on the water

  * Patience, pragmatism, emotional reserve, discipline, application (earth)
  * Represents the reality principle or realpolitik (realistic politics)

**The Battle of Actium:**
- Caesar, as a Capricorn and an earth sign, consolidates his power by binding Taurus to him
  * Taurus is Shakespeare's birth sign and a military officer in the play

**Sade's Impact**:
- Enormous influence on Decadent Late Romanticism
- Importance demonstrated by Mario Praz in "The Shadow of the Divine Marquis" in The Romantic Agony (1933)
- Prefigures Decadent sensibility in several ways:
  - Finds beauty in the horrible and revolting
  - Juxtaposes artificiality and sophistication with chthonian barbarism
  - Libertines are "indifferent to everything simple and commonplace"
  - Libertines are "self-immured," a Decadent claustrophobia
  - Corpse-strewn sexual arenas resemble the Gothic morgue

#### "Goethe's Androgynous Protagonist: An Exploration of Mignon's Transformation and Influence"

**Mignon in Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe:**
* **Enigmatic Character**: Mignon is an intriguing figure with magnetic fascination for Wilhelm. Her name has erotic associations, meaning "favorite" or "darling" in female prostitution and male homosexuality. She resembles a boyish Venetian acrobat that Goethe saw in Italy in 1790.
* **Transvestism**: Mignon is fanatical about her transvestism, passionately rejecting female clothing and identifying as a boy. After playing an angel in a pageant, she refuses to surrender her seraph's robe. She loses vital energy when abandoning male clothing and is laid out in her winged angel's costume at the funeral.
* **Categories of Androgyne**: Mignon conforms to two categories of the androgyne - the beautiful boy, Apollonian angel, but also a negative or afflicted Mercurius, the volatile shape-shifter. Her early death is foreshadowed in her unnatural excitation and frantic energy.
* **Emotional Purity and Intensity**: Mignon is an early version of Faust's Euphorion, a symbol of poetry modeled on Byron. She has palpitations, fits, and spasmodic vivacity, raving like a Maenad and dancing herself to death.
* **Innocence vs. Calculating**: Mignon is more innocent than the calculating Lady Caroline Lamb but shares her hyperactivity and spasmodic tension. Lady Caroline was childlike, boyish, angelic, monstrous, and self-destructive, constantly dancing or setting her bed and hotel afire.
* **Transvestism and Incest**: Mignon's parents mentally deteriorate, with an avenging angel appearing at the foot of their bed holding a bare knife. This prefigures Mignon's own death as an externalization of Wilhelm's double-sexed adolescence.
* **Rejection of Masquerades**: To advance from apprentice to master, Wilhelm must renounce the theater and transvestism. His new concern for permanence and continuity comes from his neoclassic side, becoming "father" and "citizen."
* **Influence on Literature**: Mignon had a long and unacknowledged influence on 19th-century literature, inspiring works like Henri de Latouche's Fragoletta (1829) and Gautier's Mademoiselle de Maupin. She is also credited to Shakespeare's continental influence.

#### "Goethe's Androgynous Desires: Sex, Suicide, and Sadomasochism in Romantic Literature"

**Romanticism and Sexuality: Goethe, Kleist, and the Late Phase of German Romanticism**

**Goethe's View on Sexuality:**
- Sex destroys beauty but precedes it (quoted from Goethe)
- Apollonian idealization vs. chthonian swampiness of sex and mother love
- Heroically self-contained and self-sufficient
- Married himself, with androgynous symbols for life work
- No vice or crime beyond his own trace (quoted from Goethe)
- Romantic art is self-exploratory, self-arousing, and self-maiming

**Goethe vs. Kleist:**
- Goethe made suicide poetic and erotic; Kleist allowed Goethe to write a grisly life-poem through him
- Goethe dreamed about suicide in Werther; Kleist committed it at age thirty-four
- Kleist's play "Penthesilea" reverses the hierarchy of sexual personae in Greek legend of Achilles and Penthesilea

**Kleist's Play "Penthesilea":**
- Militant Amazons with chthonian ferocity
- Design is sadomasochistic oscillation: assertion followed by relapse, hypnotic longing for sexual submission
- Sadistic Penthesilea aroused by masochistic fantasies in which her dead body is battered and degraded
- Achilles wants to lose, turns his neck (feminine gesture), pierced breast (Teiresias-like)
- Penthesilea drains her victim, both body and soul, castrating through devouring a penis disguised as a breast.

**Influences:**
- Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra
- Michelangelo's Giuliano de' Medici
- Flaubert's Madame Bovary
- George Eliot's Rosamond Lydgate
- Bob Dylan's "Ballad of a Thin Man"
- Phallus as breast: one explanation for penile or canine breasts of the Ephesian Artemis.

**Romanticism:**
- Large simple gestures of rebellion but charged sexual complexities and archaic pagan ritualism
- Decadence inherent in Romanticism
- Sadomasochism present from its first formulation by Rousseau.

#### "The Darker Side of Romanticism: Kleist's Penthesilea and the Erotics of Destruction"

**Key Insights:**
* Kleist's Amazon character is a hermaphrodite deity, an avatar of daemonic mother nature
* She mutilates Adam's rib cage without healing it and makes man in her own image
* Kleist focuses on the Amazons’ amputated breasts, unlike Greek artists
* Decadence is a style that operaticizes by overliteralizing
* Penthesilea's maniacal ecstasy resembles Euripides’ Agave who dismembers her son in The Bacchae
* Dionysian vision is disordering and anti-hierarchical
* Kleist's hero is fetishistically aroused by a woman's mutilating masculinization
* Penthesilea's erotics of mastectomy reflect the need to reduce self size in Late Romanticism.

**Background:**
- Kleist's Amazon character is central to his play "Penthesilea"
- She hurls Adam's rib back through his Adam's apple and mutilates his rib cage without healing it
- The detail of breast amputation is emphasized in Late Romantic literature and art, unlike Greek tradition.

**Decadence:**
- An aesthetic style of excess and extravagance approaching self-parody
- Operaticizes by overliteralizing
- Kleist's stage directions are also parodic.

**Symbolism in Literature:**
- Penthesilea's maniacal ecstasy resembles Euripides’ Agave who dismembers her son in The Bacchae
- Kissing is identified with biting, sex with appetite and cannibalism by Kleist and Swinburne.

**Romantic Solipsism:**
- Penthesilea's ritualistic oscillations between sadism and masochism are unique in Romanticism
- The play can be read allegorically as a descent into the poet's unconscious, where masculine and feminine parts fight for supremacy.

**Historical Context:**
- Late 18th century saw failure of traditional hierarchies, allowing personality to expand without self-definition or boundaries.
- The dissolution of hierarchical orders permitted personality to expand but resulted in anxiety and fear, leading to the need for chastening self and reducing size through sadomasochistic practices.

**Kleist's Background:**
- Kleist was censured for pursuing literature as an unsuitable vocation
- He tried to persuade his friends into a double suicide pact and spoke erotically about it as "the most glorious and sensual of deaths"
- His romantic union with half-sister Ulrike is reflected in Penthesilea's relationship with Achilles.

#### "Exploring the Connection between Self-Plagiarism, Gothic Literature, and Sexual Transgression in Kleist and Matthew Lewis's Works"

**The Role of Self-Plagiarism in Kleist's Work**
- Kleist is a self-plagiarist, recurring ideas and phrases throughout his work (Walter Silz)
- Self-plagiarism can be seen as incestuous or autoerotic behavior
- The case of Kleist and his sister: he was feminine, she was masculine; they had a missing sexual component towards each other
- Kleist's Romantic family romance produced the defiant Amazon manifesto of Penthesilea

**Gothic Novels in English Literature**
- Reaction against Rousseau in France censored, not absorbed into literature until later
- English reaction against Rousseau took an assimilable form: Gothic novels
- Gothic tradition began with Ann Radcliffe; The Monk by Matthew G. Lewis had the greatest impact on Romantic poets
- Gothic novel opposed the Apollonian Enlightenment's light, contour, and symmetry
- Protestant rationalism defeated by the return to medieval Catholicism and paganism in Gothic literature
- Art withdrew into dark, claustrophobic spaces: caverns, castles, prison cells, tombs
- Sexually archaic: withdrawal into chthonian darkness, realm of Goethe's Mothers (Mother night pervaded Romanticism)

**The Monk by Matthew G. Lewis**
- Influenced all English Romantic poets and other writers like Hoffmann, Poe, Hawthorne, Emily Brontë
- Medieval monastery defiled with pagan eroticism
- Matilda's transvestitism and gender fluidity prefigured Poe's Ligeia
- Homoerotic longing for a feminine pseudo-male over an available woman (Ambrosio's preference)
- Surprising revelations at the end: Matilda is a male demon sent to corrupt, incest and matricide committed by Ambrosio.
- Turned out to be a festering family romance; ending in terrible primeval isolation with Lucifer's punishment.

- Aestheticizes and sexualizes a Biblical seraph
- May be influenced by Spenser's Byzantine Belphoebe, who halts narrative action
- The "light-bearer," but hard and crystalline
- Silver branch is a golden bough, a wand used to freeze and transcend vegetative nature

**Lucifer's Impact on the Novel of Terror**
- Lucifer propels sunlit Mediterranean formalism into the daemonic murk of the Gothic novel
- Seraph may appear in Faust's Euphorion, Balzac's Seraphita, and Joyce's Ulysses
- Latent eroticism in the entire tradition of the "novel of terror"
- Thrill of terror is passive, masochistic, and implicitly feminine
- Appeals to both male and female audiences, especially adolescents experiencing sexual awakening
- High Gothic films focus on eroticized western power and the burden of history
- Moderation by Apollonian discipline is necessary to avoid gross buffoonery in horror films.

- The Mental Traveller is Blake's recognition that nature cannot be tamed into a romance of mutually rewarding sex
- The poem reflects the sadomasochistic aspects of Blake's reading of **The Faerie Queene**
- The Mental Traveller is Sade made poetry, with an acrid clarity of language that is modern or Late Romantic

**Sadean Critique of Love and Sex**:

**Nature and the Satanic Mill**
- Nature is seen as a factory that turns men into robots

#### "Blake's Psychodrama of Spectre and Emanation: A Study on Sex, Self, and Morality"

**Blake's Psychology and Personality: From Static to Fluid**

**Early 18th Century Psychology**: Character was constructed of fixed "qualities"

**Donne's "Holy Sonnet I"**: Illustrates the rational unity and simplicity of the Christian model of personality, with clear directionality and a coherent moral universe

**Blake's Personality and Theories**: Rejected Judeo-Christian morality but wanted to integrate sexuality with right action. Sex always escapes moral control. Paradoxes arise from the impossibility of redeeming sex from its association with nature

**Spectre and Emanation**: Characters in Blake's works are in identity crisis, Rousseau's invention. Territorial war is waged among parts of the self

**Emotional Landscape**: Blake's world is full of disjunctions of scale, gross expansions, and stifling diminutions. It has a spongy relativism like modern physics

**Soul Split**: The soul has split in Blake's prophetic poems, leading to questions about the "true" self

**Sexual Imagination**: Blake's psychodrama takes the form of unnatural sex acts of bizarre surrealism. He is Sade's peer in sexual imagination

**Incestuous Self-Insemination**: Example from Blake's "Urizen 19:14–16" portraying violent public sex act, with homoerotic overtones and the failure to emanate being like a prolonged pregnancy

**Homosexual Overtones**: Betrayal of self into a spectral world ruled by deceiving male figures, with homosexuality being negative and narcissistic for Blake due to its evasion of sexual contraries

**False Personae**: Arguments with one's self make art. Blake sees sexual personae as false advertisement and opposes everything hidden or set aside in special holiness

**Mixed Attitude Toward Hermaphrodites**: Androgynous state before the Fall is positive, but monstrous hermaphrodites of Experience are negative due to their imperious self-containment and spiritual blocking

**War at Jerusalem's Gate**: A vast "aggregate" hermaphrodite or "Polypus," heaving like an earthquake, representing the Dionysian androgyne

#### "Blake's Hermaphroditic Imagery: Androgyny and the Human Divine"

**Blake's Hermaphrodites**

**Chthonian Spasms**:

- Poet-hero returns from Eden to become his own hermaphroditic Shadow
- Labor pains of ingress as dead Milton forces time to run backwards
- Masquerade, assumes hermaphrodite costume to recover Emanation (Ololon)

- The male is merely a subset to woman
- Vala's torrent of abuse resembles hectoring verbal attacks in film and literature
- Invented category, "Venus Barbata," for such strident termagants

**Los's Task**:
- Break apart false hermaphrodite forms to release male and female energy
- Halts careening orgy of Daughters of Albion, who divide and unite at will

**Blake's Androgynes vs. Hermaphrodites**:
- Confusing interpretations in scholarly commentary
- Androgyne: sexually ambiguous in face, hair, frame, clothes, manner, or spirit

- Identifies human imagination with male form
- Blames Venetian and Flemish painting for losing the "outlines"

#### "Blake's Perceptual Boundaries: Ethics and Aesthetics of Identity in Art and Personality"

- Blake's barrier against nature: a perceptual device to grant objects/persons identity
- Identifies virtue with sharp-edged personality, sloth and vice with dissolution of form
- Condemns "blotting and blurring" in art, "broken lines, broken masses, and broken colours"
- Hates chiaroscuro (sfumato), calls it an "infernal machine" cranking out murk of hell

**The Hermaphrodite and Personality**
- Androgyne seemed benign to Blake but became a horror once visualized
- Explicitly hermaphroditic figures repugnant due to defiling the virtuous optical integrity of human form
- Spenser canceled his "Hermaphrodite stanzas" for similar reasons
- Blake abandoned drawings of the androgyne, has rejected hermaphrodite stanzas in The Four Zoas
- Hostility towards hermaphrodite has two sources: ethical (autonomy) and aesthetic (visionary clarity)

**The Bounding Line and Personality**
- Personality maintains its discreteness by an act of will, otherwise one person flows into another
- Bloom's anxiety of influence: firmness of line defends against overwhelming precursor
- Ultimate precursor is the Great Original (mother nature), who delegates authority to individual mothers
- Bounding line expresses need for self-origination, a territorial strategy separating male from female source

**Chiaroscuro and Secrecy in Blake's Art Theory**
- Scorn for chiaroscuro related to resentment of hidden secrets
- Calls for end to shame about genitals; wants them exposed in "Glad Day"
- Female body can never be made completely visible, as it is a dark secret place
- Art is a flight from liquidity, Blake desires to free sex from the tyrannical nature mother

**The Long Poems and Blake's Desires**
- Psychic gigantism in long poems inspired by desire to abolish secrecy of woman's reproductive matrix
- Gigantism distinctively masculine; feminine version transsexualizing, transforming female self through male potency
- Seeks to free imagination but exalts eroticism, makes chastity a perversion
- Long poems held together by force of will, full of knots, breaches, and strains.

#### "Exploring the Complexities of Blake's Poetry: Ambivalence Towards Women and the Feminine"

**Blake's Philosophical Discontinuities**
- Blake's lack of complete intelligibility comes from his philosophical discontinuities
- His hopeless but heroic task is to redeem sex from nature, a western epic saga

**Translating Blake into Moral Terms**
- Criticism is at odds with how Blake's poetry feels
- Presented as a man of peace who hates war
- But his prophetic poetry is violent and full of hostility towards mother nature
- Accumulated criticism denies there is a latent content, but moral flag-waving may conceal repressed attraction to what is being denounced

**Blake's Treatment of Women**
- His model of the future: "In Eternity Woman is the Emanation of Man she has No Will of her own There is no such thing in Eternity as a Female Will"
- Not enough to say all Blake's females are nature and all his males are man and woman together
- Whenever gender is symbolized, we must ask why

**The Daughters of Albion Passage**
- A grim ritual of nature cult
- They castrate and torture the male victim, drinking his blood
- The sex act has drained him, woman soaks up male energy for her insatiable pleasure and pride
- Blake's vivid detailing of each step shows voluptuous identification with the humiliated victim
- This is a great flight of sadomasochistic poetry, prefiguring Whitman's sexual litanies

**Blake's Virginal Figures**
- His virginity is a haughty, solitary Artemis, unlike Wordsworth's Belphoebe
- Apollonian Elynittria, "the silver bowed queen," has a "terrible" light and "immortal beauty"
- Blake finds immature the self-sequestration of Spenserian virginity

**Blake's Male Muse and Opposition to Female Hegemony**
- Claimed he took dictation from his dead brother, an extraordinary aberration in poetry history
- Milton descends into Blake's foot in his garden, poetic destiny transmitted from one male to another

- His most famous drawing is the centrifugal Glad Day, symbolizing free energy Blake loves

**Blake's Rejection of Greco-Roman Literature and Exaltation of the Bible**
- As a graphic artist, Blake is already beyond Old Testament Judaism's condemnation of image-making as idolatry
- Yahweh's injunction diverted Jewish creative energy away from the visual arts into theology, philosophy, literature, law, and science
- Blake's eccentric psychology comes from his strange combination of artist and Hebrew prophet

### Chapter 11 Marriage to Mother Nature: Wordsworth

**Biblical vs. Classical Personality**

**Biblical Personality**:
- Unitary and homogeneous
- Psychic splits are of "whited sepulcher" type
- Multiplicity is moral duality, hiding a foul heart
- Metamorphosis reserved for seraphs and gods

#### "Wordsworth's Feminized Imagination: Androgyny and the Subversion of Masculinity in Romantic Poetry"

**Wordsworth's Relationship with Femininity and Nature:**
- Wordsworth saw himself as a "nursling of the mountains," tamed by female nature (The Recluse)
- He sought to become more feminine, internalizing femininity in his spiritual evolution (The Prelude)
- Enlightenment meant androgyny for Wordsworth; he believed man must become more like his model, Nature, which is female
- Wordsworth celebrated psychic transsexualism, where the inner life of a man was colonized by feminine emotions and experiences
- He suppressed the body, the medium of masculine action, turning emotion into something without eroticism or sex (Peter Bell's protagonist)
- Wordsworth identified masculinity with corrupt adulthood and sought to prolong childhood emotional purity in genderless adulthood
- He was a "gentle creature" with a female mind, happiest when brooding like a mother dove
- Wordsworth called river or sea a female "bosom" or "breast," implying he saw himself as feminine if he was water
- Erotic passivity is implicit in Romanticism's favorite topos of the Aeolian wind-harp, symbolizing the artist's subordination to nature's inspiring power.

**Wordsworth's Ideal of Contemplativeness:**

#### "Wordsworth's Poetry: The Exclusion of Masculine Virility"

**Wordsworth's Exclusion of Masculine Men in His Poetry:**
- Wordsworth identified society with masculinity, excluding the masculine male from his poetry
- Men must suffer some curtailment of virility to be included in Wordsworth's work
- Virile males are portrayed as old, impoverished, or suffering from physical or spiritual afflictions
- Characters like sailors and soldiers are admired for their obsolescence and desolation
- Men are reduced to children, women, old men, and animals in Wordsworth's poetry
- The only instance of a virile man is a primitive Briton from prehistory

**Wordsworth's Attitude Towards Virility:**
- Virility is documented only when lost or distanced through memory
- Men become greater as they become less, self-sacrifice and public martyrdom canonize them in the cult of female nature
- Wordsworth condemned open sexuality, like Lord Nelson's affair with Emma, Lady Hamilton, despite admiring it in others
- The happy warrior is a philosopher rather than a soldier, making his moral being his prime care.

**Examples of Masculine Men Portrayed in Wordsworth's Poetry:**

- Murderer-exile in "The Prelude"
- Young man in "Michael" who faces disaster in dissolute London

#### "Wordsworth's Androgynous Imagery: The Laborer, Mary, and Dorothy"

**Wordsworth's Sexual Personae and Themes in "The Prelude"**

**Laborer as Androgyne (Teiresias)**
- Wordsworth sees a laborer caring for a sick baby, modeling himself upon nature's maternal spirit
- Unconsciously, the laborer has adopted feminine qualities
- The laborer is a male mother figure, softening his gender and making it tolerable for the poet

**Matriculation in Wordsworth's Universe**
- To matriculate means to enter the realm of womb and mother
- Wordsworth soaks beings with tenderizing mother-emotion
- Only disadvantaged minorities (women, children, old men) have privileged status under a special admissions program
- Males seeking acceptance must undergo a perilous rite de passage or become mothers

**Wordsworth's Relationship with Mary Hutchinson and Dorothy Wordsworth**
- Called Mary "a Phantom of delight," "a lovely Apparition," and an "Image gay"
- She is "a Spirit, yet a Woman too" and moves upward in the chain of being
- Lucy dies into formal indeterminacy, reduced to matter and loses her gender
- Dorothy is bodiless and sexless in "Tintern Abbey," an incarnation of Wordsworth's earlier self
- Gazing into Dorothy's face, Wordsworth sees his past self reflected in her eyes

**Proteus as a Symbol of Emotional Flux**
- Proteus changes shape to elude pursuers and represents the flux of Wordsworth's emotions
- Wordsworth mentally grasps his externalized sister (Dorothy) to prevent his vision of union with nature from slipping away
- The participial phrases in "The Prelude" and "To the Lighthouse" are a ritual formalization and distancing of intolerable emotion.

#### "The Anima in Times of Crisis: Nixon, Wordsworth, and the Power of Motherly Love"

**Wordsworth's Relationship with Sister Dorothy and Femininity in His Poetry**
- **Nixon and Mother**: Nixon was moved by memories of his mother during his moment of crisis, which some saw as calculated. Italians do not find it strange to reference one's mother at significant moments.
- **Wordsworth and Dorothy**: Wordsworth had a strong spiritual connection with his sister Dorothy, who served as his "Muse" and guide through emotional turmoil in his poetry. This relationship has been described as Romantic incest, but it is unlikely to have been sexual. Instead, it represented a metaphor for returning to primal sources of inspiration.
- **Wordsworth's Spiritual Identity**: Wordsworth believed the highest condition for an imaginative person was "singleness," which he saw as an androgynous state beyond normality. This allowed him to remain superbly alone, a magus contemplating reality without being subordinated to it.
- **Femininity in Wordsworth's Poetry**: Female figures in Wordsworth's poetry are often blurred or seraphicized, ceasing to be physical objects and becoming symbols of spiritual connection. This contrasts with his detailed descriptions of aged male solitaries who exist in a melancholic state of contraction from nature.
- **Wordsworth's Eye and Aggression**: Wordsworth's poetry demonstrates the secret aggression in Rousseauist sympathy, as he throws his vision out like a harpoon to create a sympathetic emotional aura around objects. This force can also desiccate and crush the subjects of his observations, reflecting the duality of his love and compassion for nature.

**Wordsworth**:
- Spent a lifetime editing out brute reality in his poetry

- Faced tension between imagination and morality, as shown in "Christabel"
- Drew on underground currents of western culture: Hermeticism, alchemy, astrology

**The Rime of the Ancient Mariner:**
- Passive suffering of the protagonist central to the poem (Wordsworth's observation)
- Extraordinary passivity of the Mariner (George Whalley)

#### "The Ancient Mariner: A Study of Self-Identification and Vision in Coleridge's Poetry"

**Sagas of Male Heroine**
- Self-identification endangers artistically in male heroine sagas
- Mariner's "grey beard" and "skinny hand" recall Wordsworthian solitaries
- Ill-written passages, rhyme is ritualistic chiming, and darkening cloud of fate
- Coleridge's "conversation poems" are minor works compared to his imagination

**Coleridge vs. Poe: Disjunction of Form and Content**
- Both giants of imagination with daemonic expressions that transcend language

**Coleridge's The Ancient Mariner**

**The Mariner's Vision**:
- Propelled backward to a maternal world
- Ship was becalmed: "The very deep did rot"
- Vision of primal nondifferentiation, the chthonian swamp of generation
- Universe had returned to one big womb, claustrophobic and airless
- Teeming with monstrous prehuman mud creatures
- Mariner's appeal to Christ was opposite of what it seemed
- Coleridge understood the swamp-world preceded the world of Christ

**The "Slime Sea"**:
- Refers to the chthonian swamp of nondifferentiation
- Men emerge covered in slime, gasping for life
- Male power can never surpass female power
- Our mother-born bodies are unregenerate nature beyond God's redemption

**The Failure of Appeals to Good**:
- Invocation of Christ's name failed to release the Mariner

* Long hair has been associated with dangerous egotism in the west since ancient times (e.g., Absalom from the Bible)
* In earlier periods, long, unkempt hair was worn by outsiders seeking charisma and attention
* Napoleon's feminine element is tied to his youthful, gaunt appearance with long hair; later, he adopted a more masculine Caesar-style cut

#### "The Romance of Speed: Byron, Rock Music, and the American Spirit"

**Connection to Camilla**
- Jackson Knight: Idea of fleet figure running atop grain stalks may have originated in Volscian belief in "the presence of some spirit of the corn"
- Meadows' wavelike motion is wind's invisible steps, "breeziness of Don Juan" is freshness of spring breeze
- Byron's "emanation" is the spirit of youth, impacting European and American culture

**Byronic Youth Culture**
- Rousseau invented modern cult of childhood, Goethe popularized moody adolescent
- But Byron created glamourous sexy youth of brash, defiant energy
- Dawn of age of speed: transient youth = swiftness in emotionally transient form
- Byron's spirit seems to have transmigrated into engine of speed (first locomotive appeared in 1825)

#### "The Androgynous Beauty and Charismatic Power of Byron and Presley: A Study in Contrast"

**Lord Byron and Elvis Presley:** Androgynous Beauty and Charisma

**Byron's Description:**
- Described as having an "effeminate" voice and accent by Lady Blessington
- Friends saw a "feminine cast of character" in his caprices, fits of weeping, sudden affections, and dislikes
- Belonged to the category of Epicoene, or the man of beauty (Michelangelo's Giuliano de’ Medici)
- Jane Porter found his complexion "softly brilliant" with a "moonlight paleness"
- Lady Blessington called his face "peculiarly pale," set off by curling hair of "very dark brown"

**Elvis Presley:**
- White skin, dark oiled hair: similar to Byron's description
- Dyed his brown-blonde hair black despite friends' urging to let the natural color return
- Understood the essence of his archetypal beauty as a myth-maker
- Looked alike in strong-nosed Greek profile with Lord Byron (fig. 34)
- Had a captivating soft-spoken charm and manners that were manly and gentle
- The Romantic curling lip is aristocratic disdain, Elvis joked about it (twitched his mouth and murmured "I've got something on my lip")

**Comparisons:**
- Both had late Orientalizing periods: Byron went to fight Turks in Greek war of independence, died mysteriously; Presley had a Mithraic style in later years with jewel-encrusted silk jumpsuits and accessories
- Started as flaming assertions of youthful male will but ended as ornate objets de culte
- Both were world-shapers, conduits of titanic force, yet deeply emotional and sentimental
- Both suffered chronic ailments that didn't mar their glossy complexions or robust beauty
- Died prematurely: Byron at 36, Presley at 42

**Political Consequences:**
- Buckingham's (another man of beauty) domination deformed the workings of the King's government and patronage system
- Sowed disaffection in the Court and was a prime cause of enmity on the political scene
- Brought the royal regime into hatred and contempt, leading to England's regicidal revolution

**Excess Charisma:**
- Dangerous to both self and others
- Byron, as a Romantic exile, did England a favor by releasing energy and beauty together in a burning, godlike manner.

**Byron, Shelley, and Keats: The Second Generation of Romantic Poets**

**Modern Charismatic Personality and Popular Culture**:
- Byron created a youth-cult that influenced Elvis Presley's fame
- In the affluent commercial culture, Byron was able to ignore politics and build his empire
- Mass media act as a barrier protecting politics from unbalanced charismatic personalities like Byron
- Today's Byronic man of beauty dominates the imagination, not a Buckingham who disorders the state

**Lyric Poetry and Romantic Poets**:
- The first generation of Romantic poets forcefully created themselves out of the declining 18th century
- Their personalities were conflicted and contradictory, grand even in disarray
- The second generation was breezier but lacked stamina
- Byron, Shelley, and Keats lyricized reality, using simple parallelism between nature and emotion
- They expanded the lyric to extraordinary length, but this did not protect them from the torment implicit in lyric emotion

**Other Androids in Literature**:
- Wilde's entranced Salomé and Lawrence's Hermione Roddice
- Film stars like Garbo, Tierney, Novak, Deneuve
- Emotional lifelessness is psychological abstraction, a masculine impersonality

**The Hermaphrodite in Shelley's Poetry**:

**Platonic Connection**:
- In her roman à clef, Lodore (1835), Mary depicts the relationship as platonic

- Shelley makes his own wife his sister (Emilia's twin) within the heterosexual coupling
- Emilia is both Shelley's wife and sister
- Every relation contracts to family romance for the Romantic poet

- The relationship challenges the reader to guess whether Emilia is the Dark Lady or the beautiful boy

**Shelley's "Psyche-Epipsyche Strategy"**:
- Shelley's psyche imaginatively creates the epipsyche (a soul within a soul) and seeks to possess it
- The femininity of Shelley's epipsyche is not what his psyche does not have, as Romantics never repress masculinity

#### "Shelley's Hermaphroditic Love: The Transformative Power of Gender Fluidity in Epipsychidion"

**Shelley's Relationship with Female Power and Heraphroditism in Epipsychidion**

**Persona of Ritual Dependency**:

- Mill idolized Harriet Taylor, who he called a genius and his intellectual superior
- However, Mill's comparison of Harriet to Shelley revealed her unremarkable qualities
- The relationship may have energized both parties creatively

**Shelley's Portrayal in Epipsychidion**:
- In the poem, Shelley portrays himself as a "dizzy moth" seeking "a radiant death" in the flame of his dream-image
- He chronicles his erotic history with three major women, who become comet, moon, and sun exerting power over him
- Shelley is the "hunted deer" pierced by Emilia's raylike solar arrows
- At times, Emilia is a gentle sister or "poor captive bird," but also an Amazonian figure with "the tempestuous loveliness of terror"

**Shelley's Apollonian Vision**:
- Shelley's idealizations are often compared to the Greek god Apollo, who represents the visible world and eye-dominated radiance
- His purity would be no less Greek were his imaginary island off Scotland
- The union with Emilia is a "no-sex marriage," where they come together as "vestal sister" and "bride" to the poet's spirit

**The Poem's Voyage into the Past**:
- The poem describes a voyage to an idyllic Greek island, which is life in the womb where incestuous twins unite
- The union with Emilia veers in an unexpected direction, as social personae recede and Shelley falls silent while his choral commentary continues

#### "Shelley's Epipsychidion: A Study on Western Erotic Perversity and the Search for Androgynous Identity"

**Shelley's Two Hermaphrodite Poems**
- **Two continuous movements:** Shelley's two Hermaphrodite poems make a single, continuous movement
- **Superheated psychoalchemic experiment:** Like Coleridge's "Christabel," Epipsychidion is a superheated psychoalchemic experiment that releases and rebonds sexual energy
- **Orgasmic sexuality vanquished and transcended:** Body is consumed in the flames of imagination, which lights and heats the poem. However, Epipsychidion implodes
- **Extinction of all identity:** The search for a new gender-free eroticism ends in the extinction of all identity
- **Unity of incestuous twinship collapses into nondifferentiation:** Incest restores primeval chaos
- **Shelley sinks into dispiriting density:** Shelley's poem is reclaimed by the chthonian, much like the swamp mud of the Great Mother
- **Impossible task:** Attempting to reconcile regression to the womb with Apollonian seraphicization (burning away and ascent of gender-limited body)
- **Malign gravitation:** At the moment the poet thinks himself victorious, the earth exerts its malign gravitation and plummets him downward to her embrace
- **Summoning the archaic mother:** Shelley's parting from Emilia Viviani was not cordial. He ended by suppressing Epipsychidion

- **Revulsion from Emilia Viviani:** Shelley's disillusionment came when Emilia suddenly looked like a woman instead of an androgyne
- **Dante's Vita Nuova:** Epipsychidion is Shelley's Vita Nuova, with its charismatic adolescent Beatrice
- **Narcissistic personality:** Dante's Beatrice was a narcissistic personality, a girl-boy to whom the obsessed poet ritually subjected himself
- **Aesthetic swerve:** Shelley's revulsion from Emilia Viviani was an aesthetic swerve
- **Incest is poetical circumstance:** Incest coexists outside the norm. Romantic incest is a closed internal world that regresses to prehistory.

#### "The Romantic Obsession with Incest and Sexual Ambiguity in Literature: A Study of Byron, Shelley, and Their Contemporaries"

**Poe's Ushers and Incest**
- Desire shrinks from contact with aliens in Poe's clannish, incestuous Ushers
- Incest had an aristocratic elitism in antiquity

#### "Shelley's 'Ode to the West Wind': A Sexualized Exploration of Passive Creativity and Romantic Mutilation"

**Shelley's "Ode to the West Wind" and Romantic Imagination**

**Background:**
- Poem about poet's relationship with nature, comparing himself to dead leaf and moth
- Wind as creative force, both destructive and productive
- Passive role of the poet in the process

**Thesis:**
- Shelley explores masculine and feminine aspects of creativity through his poem "Ode to the West Wind"
- Romantic artists' mutilation is a form of self-limitation and ritual sacrifice

**Masculine and Feminine in Romantic Imagination:**
- Male artists have a female bower within themselves, making them sensitive and impressionable
- Passivity toward overwhelming consciousness leads to anxiety and fear of evil
- The poet's femininity allows him to cope with the unknown and unrationalized aspects of nature and self.

**Symbolism in "Ode to the West Wind":**
- Poet as dead leaf/moth: acknowledging his mortality, insignificance in the face of natural forces
- West wind: creative force that both destroys (ashes) and inseminates (sparks), representing masculine aggression and feminine receptivity
- Passive role of poet: surrendering to the power of nature, becoming an instrument of its transformation.

**Romantic Artists' Mutilation:**
- Sacrifice of virility as a response to overwhelming consciousness
- Anxiety about evil in the absence of church and state certitudes
- Daemonic epiphanies: self ambushes, harasses, flails itself in fear of unknown forces.

**Keats vs. Wordsworth:**
- Keats restores sensuality and eroticism to nature, unlike Wordsworth's abandonment
- Suppression of sexual anxiety in poems versus open expression in letters
- Theory of creativity: "Negative Capability" - remaining passive and receptive to uncertainties and mysteries.

**Additional Points:**
- Romantic artists were fascinated by the feminine aspects of their imagination due to the limitations imposed on them by society's strict gender roles.
- The role of passion in creativity can lead to exhaustion and draining of energy, as noted by Nietzsche.
- Shelley saw the poet as a "kindly one," turning every Fury into a "Kindly One," palliating the unpalatable facts of female power.

#### "Keats's Androgynous Imagination: Transforming the Feminine in Literature"

**Keats's Poetic Transformations**

**Keats's Dionysian Self-Transformations:**
- Turns into various beings: wraith, winds, water, earth, stars, plants, animals
- Identifies with nature and creates vivid sensory imagery in his poetry
- Represents the feminine receptacle for the Many of nature
- Seen as a transsexual shaman or androgynous figure

**The Mind of a Genius:**
- Men of genius lack individuality or determined character
- Keats's poetic mind is a "soft nest" where beloveds sleep
- Identifies emotional life with the feminine heart-breast
- Primacy given to emotional life, identified as feminine

**Keats's Indolence and Imagination:**
- Male body slowed down to natural process rhythms
- Sleeping heroines are nature's sacralization or neutralization
- Heart is "the teat from which the Mind or intelligence sucks its identity"

**The Eve of St. Agnes:**
- Most brilliantly written part: male reverses sexual convention and feeds female
- Mouth-embowering imagery induces liquidity and salivation in the reader
- Keats's least flight from liquidity, finds enhanced imagination in the moist

**Keats vs. Raphael:**
- Both close to all-benign, but eluded by their artistic fathers
- "Lamia" recapitulates Oresteia, where Apollo triumphs over female daemonism
- Keatsian charm is the aura of the poet's best wishes towards Lamia

**Keats's Letters to Fanny Brawne:**
- Turbulent letters seethe with jealousy, hostility, and obsession
- Biographer Walter Jackson Bate struggles to reconcile emotional and creative lives.

#### "Keats's Complex Relationship with Women: Beyond Empathy and Identification"

**Keats's Attitude Towards Women**

**Key Points:**
- Keats struggled to have a right feeling towards women, often feeling suspicious and lacking identification with them
- This may be due to his strong empathic and sympathetic nature that led to over-identification when around women
- The idealized view of Keats leaves scholars at a loss with "La Belle Dame Sans Merci," a supreme Romantic poem featuring a Circean sexual predator
- Scholars disagree on the interpretation of this poem, with some seeing it as allegorical while others argue for its primary sexual level
- The poem's heroine is nonhierarchic and disarming, exerting her power only a posteriori through the reactions she provokes in men
- Keats may have been influenced by Lady Caroline Lamb, an androgynous figure known for her ruthless behavior and nervous energy

**Keats's View of Women Intellectuals:**
- Keats had a low opinion of women intellectuals, which relates to his poems on sexual danger
- Some scholars see this as part of his antipathy towards the trendy literary world
- The poem "Hyperion" and its sequel "The Fall of Hyperion" record crises of poetic belatedness and male impotence in the face of female domination

**Keats's Sex Reversal:**
- In Keats's poetry, women force themselves into the poet's personality through spiritual intercourse, raping the ephebic poet and injecting him with a sense of reality
- This sex reversal is evident in "The Fall of Hyperion," where Moneta's hollow brain is "enwombed" by the poet's sensuous white soft temples.

* Keats tries to abolish sexual personae but is haunted by daemonic hierarchic females
* Decadence objects and fixates on western sexual personae, transforming them into beautiful things.

**The Influence of French Romanticism:**
* Decadence as the late phase of Romantic style in France
* Shuts down freedom, creating new limits psychosexually and artistically
* Fashioned from Sadean and Coleridgian nature theories
* Art supplants nature; objet d'art becomes center of fetishistic connoisseurship
* Person is transformed into beautiful thing beyond the law
* Decadence an Apollonian raid on Dionysian, objectifying and freezing nature's roiling objects.

- Also resembles Byron's sultana Gulbeyaz, who wears a poniard
- First ferocious chthonian female of the Decadence, prefiguring Cleopatra, Herodias, and Salomé

#### "Exploring the Androgynous Nature of Love and Desire in Balzac's 'The Girl with the Golden Eyes' and 'Seraphita'"

**Gang Rape and Androgyny in Balzac's "The Girl with the Golden Eyes"**

**Femininity as a Disaster**:
- Gang rape by army platoons or fraternity brothers may conceal subliminal homosexual impulses.
- The marquise and De Marsay meet in the body of Paquita, whom they both inseminate. They flood her with their superior force, sweeping her away.
- Brother and sister have "the same voice." Both are aesthetes, sensualists, murderers.

**Balzac's "The Girl with the Golden Eyes"**:
- **Paquita**: The illiterate girl knows nothing but sex, practicing a sexual alchemy to discover and reinforce the twinship of the marquise and De Marsay.
- Paquita's rape-murder is induced by her flirting with De Marsay.
- Naturalistically, De Marsay deputizes his friends to overcome the mansion's guards, but archetypally, he needs male companions to retain his own gender in a hallucinatory female environment.

**Romanticism and Incest**:
- The Renaissance twins arouse and satisfy multiple erotic responses, but the Romantic twins solipsistically focus on and obliterate the same girl, in an incestuous cul-de-sac.
- For their mutual recognition, brother and sister return to their poetic origins in the Byronic seraglio, a Delphic omphalos-spot.

**Seraphita**:
- Balzac's "Seraphita" (1833-1835) is the Inferno of The Human Comedy, the opposite half to The Girl with the Golden Eyes.
- Seraphita is an androgyne as Apollonian angel, belonging to the category of Wordsworth's Witch or Shelley's Hermaphrodite.

**Cellini's Saga vs. Balzac's Romantic Saga**: Cellini's saga ends with artist and art work separated by social distance. Balzac's Romantic saga ends with self and work united. The self is the work of art, another Romantic coalescence of doubles.

**Seraphita as Symbol of Perfected Man**: Seraphita as symbol of perfected man may be influenced by social theorists like Ballanche and Saint-Simon, who identified the androgyne with liberal reform and universal brotherhood.

**The Optimistic Androgyne**: The only nineteenth-century example of the public (rather than personalistic) androgyne of the Renaissance kind.

**Setting and Significance**: Balzac sets his tale in 1800, suggesting that his era breaks with the past through Seraphita's sexual revelation, like Freud postdating **The Interpretation of Dreams**.

**Inversion of Hermaphrodite Stars**: **The Girl with the Golden Eyes** and **Seraphita** answer each other, inverting their hermaphrodite stars. In **The Girl with the Golden Eyes**, two androgynes are murderously aligned toward a conventional center. In **Seraphita**, two conventional genders are lovingly aligned toward a median hermaphrodite.

**Culture and Nature**: **The Girl with the Golden Eyes** is infused with southern sexual passion, recreated in the marquise's opulent boudoir. **Seraphita** chills sex and gender on Nordic ice. Body vs. mind, sensuality vs. abstraction: like D. H. Lawrence, Balzac diagrams the European cultural schizophrenia. Nature is in bondage to the seraph. The ice cracks and nature revives only when Seraphita weakens and dies.

**Circular Pattern of Sex and Geography**: Balzac's two tales check and correct each other in a circular pattern of sex and geography.

**Androgynous Personae in The Human Comedy**: In Balzac's major character triad, Eugène de Rastignac and Lucien de Rubempré are enslaved by the Machiavellian master criminal Vautrin. Transsexual similes applied to Eugène make his feminine narcissism visible. Lucien apes the dandy De Marsay, whose moral seduction of Dorian recalls Vautrin's of Lucien.

**Félicité des Touches**: One of Balzac's major female androgynes, based on George Sand, is the novelist Félicité des Touches, whom Balzac calls "the illustrious hermaphrodite" because of her masculine genius.

**Cousin Bette**: The heroine of **Cousin Bette** is an androgyne in a different mode, the chthonian. She is "a primitive peasant" with a "masculine stiff temperament," energized by her emotional proximity to nature. Her "love of power" is awakened by a weak-willed Polish artist. Balzac thought celibacy crucial for artistic and intellectual productivity.

- Balzac aspired to aristocracy, ennobling himself by adding "de" to his name
- Balzac's coarse female androgynes are closer to him in body and mind than his idealized male androgyne fantasies

#### "Exploring the Androgyne in Literature: A Comparative Analysis of Emma, Vanity Fair, and Social Novels"

**Stuart M. Tave's Analysis of Emma**
- Emma is defeated by the novel's "ordered form and truth" that maintains its "beautiful and inevitable course." (Tave, 1986)
- The novel serves to humanize and normalize Emma for marriage, which is a foundation of the social order.
- Emma is described as having "charismatic personality," but her pretensions are checked by the novel itself.
- Parallel to English Renaissance literature, Emma sacrifices her androgyny for the public good.
- Emma's double-sexed charm is an enchantment that not all readers are susceptible to.
- The "mysterious iridescence" of Emma's half-repellent character has evoked a body of criticism unusual in its fineness. (Tave, 1986)

**Emma vs. Vanity Fair**
- **Vanity Fair** features Rebecca Sharp, who has Emma's manipulativeness and Cousin Bette's cold male will.
- Becky's "masculine force of personality" upstages the nominal heroine, Amelia Sedley. (Tave, 1986)
- **Vanity Fair** maintains its opposition to glamour, which appears as an amoral hardness.
- Becky's rare visits to her neglected son are in a "radiant style of Apollonian epiphany," but she is criticized for evading ordinariness and simple homely emotion. (Tave, 1986)

**The Apollonian Hierarch vs. the Social Novel**
- The **Apollonian hierarch** is a narcissist, frozen in moral adolescence.
- Apollonian glamour always occurs at the expense of the ethical.
- The social novel differs from Renaissance and Romantic literature in its resistance to the mystically transcendent personality.
- Personality change in the social novel may come through petty, grinding humiliations, unlike the sudden turns of Fortune's wheel in Renaissance drama. (Tave, 1986)

**Aristocracy and Androgyne in the Social Novel**
- The purer the social novel, the more negative it is to the androgyne.
- The greater the influx of Romantic consciousness, as in Virginia Woolf, the greater the frequency of hermaphroditic personae. (Tave, 1986)
- Dickens disagrees with George Eliot on several basic issues, his social structures are oppressive and emotion-killing compared to Eliot's educative structures leading from self-involvement to community.

**Dickens vs. George Eliot**
- Dickens is more receptive to male androgynes of benevolent eccentricity, like quirky Mr. Micawber or holy lunatics.
- His virtuous characters retain the unitary qualities of childhood: innocence, purity, simplicity. (Tave, 1986)
- Dickens' novels retain elements of the parable or morality play and feature androgynous apparitions in his allegories, like the three sexless or sexually dual apparitions in "A Christmas Carol."

**Androgyne in French Novels vs. English Social Novel**
- The French novel's adolescent androgyne is more common and enjoys thematic centrality compared to the English social novel.
- The French novel's self-projection into unlucky heroes is tinged with satire, like Byron's ironic affection for his fresh-faced Don Juan. (Tave, 1986)
- Madame Bovary contains Flaubert's spiritual struggles and sexual contradictions, embodying both masculine and feminine qualities.

#### "Exploring the Ambiguous Female Figure in 19th Century Literature: From Emma to Nana"

**Anna Karenina: A Comparative Analysis with Madame Bovary and Nana**
- Anna Karenina (1873–76) is Tolstoy's version of Madame Bovary, pitting another willful adulteress against social constraint
- Emma's latent masculinity survives in Anna's severe black-velvet ball dress and tendency for women to fall "in love with" or "lose their hearts" to her
- Society wins; the heroines are defeated, often through suicide

**Comparison with Nana**:
- Emile Zola’s Nana (1880) intensifies the ambivalences of earlier 19th-century heroines like Emma and Anna Karenina
- Nana is a perverse version of Bovary and Karenina, taking prostitution instead of adultery
- Nana is described as a "force of nature," an "Amazon," and a "maneater" who dominates Paris and undermines civilization
- Zola condemns the "Great Mother" as the Whore of Babylon, and the book ends with a geological description of Nana's corpse

**Androgyny in Social Novels**:
- Androgyne characters like Becky Sharp and Nana disrupt public structures by destabilizing society
- Social novels agree with epics in disciplining the androgyne for the social whole
- In contrast, Coleridge's Geraldine remains intact in Christabel, as do Baudelaire and Huysman's vampires

**Comparison of Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights**:
- Emily Brontë's Wuthering Heights is High Romantic, with sex and emotion incestuous and solipsistic

**Family Dynamics:**

- Emily Brontë possessed all necessary masculinity for creating hero

**Emily Brontë's Masculinity:**
- Stronger than a man, simpler than a child (Charlotte Brontë)
- Temper was magnanimous but warm and sudden
- Spirit unbending
- Tallest family member aside from father
- Nicknamed "the Major" by Charlotte Brontë
- Physically resembled George Henry Lewes, called Emily's "face almost moves me to tears"

**Heathcliff's Character:**
- Colossal figure in the novel
- Charged with excess of sex-crossing aspiration
- Weakness betrays transsexual origins
- Denying Byronic hero consummate virility, Emily Brontë sees through mask

**Sexual Metathesis:**
- Overreaching strategy to defy gender dictatorship
- Examples: Byron's transformation of John Edleston into Thyrza, Proust's Albertine, Virginia Woolf's Orlando
- Expansion of identity through erotic sensation and metaphysical advance

**Decline in "Wuthering Heights":**
- Two parts: first half is memorable, second part "unevenly felt" (Pritchett)
- Loss of intensity due to psychoiconicism, fascination with personality over narrative
- Heathcliff loses his aura of glamour and archetypal force in the naturalistic decline.

#### "Exploring the Hidden Erotic Themes in Emily Brontë's Wuthering Heights"

**Wuthering Heights and Emily Brontë's Sexual Metathesis**

**Background:**
- Emily Brontë's novel, "Wuthering Heights," initially showed great force but later reduced in scale and style
- Brontë's sexual metathesis with the character Heathcliff is linked to her incestuous-twin theme

**Brontë's Homosexual Feelings for Catherine:**
- She wrote passionate love poems after leaving a girls' school, suggesting no opportunity for heterosexual relationships
- Delicate lesbian eroticism found in Brontë's lyrics focusing on night approach of angelic female spirits and smoothness/softness

**Family Romance and Influence on "Wuthering Heights":**
- Maria Brontë, the precocious eldest sister who had taken over guidance of her siblings at a young age, died twenty years before Emily wrote the novel
- The phantom of Maria became the incestuous Romantic sister-spirit to Emily's male poetic genius in "Wuthering Heights"
- Byron's life and work were recreated through Brontë's submerged lesbian incest and fusion of homosexual liaisons and incest with his half-sister

**Symbolism:**
- The sister's phantom makes a terrifying appearance in both "Manfred" and "Wuthering Heights," suggesting symbolic sexual injury
- Maria is Emily's sacrificial Muse, the repressed and projected feminine half that comes from outside

**Emily Brontë's Masculine Imagination:**
- Stern, sudden, and austere, Brontë was masculine in relation to a hovering female fructification
- The ghost tapping at the window is a girl who presses at the portals of consciousness and may be a lost lesbian beloved or lamented late sister
- Lockwood fears the ghost as a strangler, suggesting desire and hostility towards the female archetype

**Nature Without a Mother:**
- Unlike Wordsworth and Woolf, Brontë did not respond to her mother's death with a Cybele-myth of creative natural process
- She stripped Wordsworthian maternalism from nature through self-desexualization as Heathcliff
- "Wuthering Heights" promulgates a nature-cult without a goddess, resembling pagan rituals like the high priest's offering of blood to Cybele

**Branwell Brontë's Role:**
- If there was a symbiotic twin connection between Emily and Branwell, it may have resided in her sense that she had somehow stolen her brother's masculinity
- Emily caught cold at Branwell's funeral, refused rest and medical aid, and died shortly thereafter, suggesting a rite of guilt and atonement.

#### "Emily Brontë's Wuthering Heights: A Study of Identity and Transformation in Literature"

**Emily Brontë's Relationship with Her Brother and Gender Identity in Wuthering Heights:**
- Emily Brontë felt she had usurped her brother's gender for her own purposes in creating her imaginative success
- This behavior is similar to Heathcliff's desire to unite with Catherine beyond the grave
- Merged with her hero, taking his asceticism for her own
- Final days showed hostility towards the body and its role in gender

**Love and Identity in Wuthering Heights:**
- Love's feverish battle is a quest for primeval unity
- Wuthering Heights contains a more perverse psychodrama: body as an affront to imagination and emotion, which is homosexual-tending
- Body torn by novel's sadomasochism
- Formal innovations of Wuthering Heights came from Brontë's own displacements of identity
- Narrators and shifts in time/point of view were layers intercession between real and fictive self
- Brontë was central to the novel, projecting herself into Heathcliff
- Treated her sexual identity as an abstraction in another dimension
- Maturely measured sense of self and projected persona

**Heathcliff's Identity:**
- Is he a man? If so, is he mad? And if not, is he a devil?
- Partially perceived as monster and not a human being
- Half a man, not fully male
- Transfigured woman hero

**Impact of Wuthering Heights:**
- Brontë died the year after publication, poorly received
- Possible that novel's extremism was career-ending
- One body of self-referential work rather than a social historian.

### Chapter 18 Romantic Shadows: Swinburne and Pater

**Romanticism vs. Victorianism in Emily Brontë's Work**
- **The second half of Brontë's work**: Heathcliff/Catherine's monumentality dwindles to a thin pale light, voices heard from a distance. Romanticism yields to Victorianism, with the pleasant, ordered present Brontë refuses to dwell in.
- **Extending and revising High Romanticism**: Brontë follows Byron, Shelley, and Keats by electing to die young at the height of imagination.

**Swinburne's Poetry: English Late Romanticism**
- Swinburne's poetry marks the paganism of Romanticism becoming overtly pagan. He uses French Decadence to reinforce Coleridge against Wordsworth.
- Swinburne had enormous influence on English literature, but his most lurid and central poems are often excluded from Victorian poetry courses.
- **French Late Romanticism**: Predicated on worship of objets d'art thanks to Gautier's transfer of perceptual relations from the visual to sexual realm.
- **English Decadence**: More concerned with style, the self-consciously beautiful mode of discourse of an epicene male persona, rather than objets.
- Swinburne sets Baudelaire's Decadent vampires in Sade's violent nature, reflecting English high culture's incapability for continental contempt for nature.

**Swinburne's Poetry: Female Monarchism and Paganism**
- Swinburne's poetry demolishes Victorian society and plants matriarchy amid patriarchy. He is a female monarchist, fusing sex and hierarchy in his work.
- His first published work was "The Queen-Mother," which boldly fuses sex and hierarchy. Swinburne sweeps Christianity away to restore the archaic mother-religions.
- Swinburne's peculiar incantatory style is parodied, but it recovers and restores the ritual origins of art. His poetry shows paganism as a severe code of ritual limitation that curbs the dangerous daemonism of sex and nature.

**Dolores: An Anti-Mary and Our Lady of Torture**
- Dolores is an inversion of the sacred epithets, creating an Anti-Mary and removing herself from the Christian world altogether. She is "Our Lady of Pain" who brings suffering to male victims as the Marquis de Sade's prophet, preacher, and poet.

#### "Swinburne's Dark Goddesses: Dolores and Faustine as Incarnations of Evil and Disorder"

**Swinburne's "Faustine" and "The Splendid and Sterile Dolores"**

**Themes:**
- Chthonian vs. Apollonian: Swinburne explores the darker, incestuous side of Shelley (Apollonian) through his matriarchal trinity, Dolores.
- Transtemporal Principle of Evil: Dolores is an eternal principle defiling history and frustrating procreative processes.
- Sexual Syncretism: Identification with rulers, gods, male and female from ancient chronicles.
- Decadence and Falling Away: The speaker's thought perpetually circles back to one sexual focal point in each stanza.
- Poetic Style: Short lines, harsh meter, relentless alliterations that dramatize repetition compulsion.
- Ritualistic Poetry: Few things provide as intense a replication of primitive experience as Swinburne's poems.

**Characters:**
- Dolores: A chthonian figure representing evil and disorder, an incestuous triad or matriarchal trinity, sterile and vaster in scale than Baudelaire’s vampire poems.
- Faustine: A daemonic Cosmic Woman, a queen whose kingdom ebbs and shifts each week, with plural sexuality drawn to lesbianism for its necrophiliac compost heap.

**Symbolism:**
- Mother Nature: Swinburne’s Dolores and Faustine are goddesses who rule flux and change like Fortuna gambling with dead men's bones.
- The Devil: Faustine's vampire who cannot die, her poem has an insomniac obsessiveness.

**Impact:**
- Malice toward High Victorian culture: Swinburne's criticism of the Roman synthesis of intellect and imperialism results in metamorphic identities that contaminate both language and action.

#### "The Female Domination of Swinburne's Poetic Universe: A Study on Sexual Power and Divide"

**The Poem's Metaphorical Depiction:**
- The poem is an automaton driven by a robotlike female despot, representing Faustine as a barren bone mill with daemonic internal transactions.
- Dolores and Faustine are titanic projections of female hierarchic authority, embodying sensual embowered passivity and sex reversal.

**Swinburne's Mannerist Metaphors:**
- Dolores' cruelly laughing lips are curled snakes disconnected from her face by Decadent fission.
- She attacks a male breast, draining blood rather than milk, representing Swinburne as the Teiresian androgyne who assumes the Great Mother's parturient powers but receives abuse instead.

**The Male Perspective:**
- Man is no Muse; Swinburne evades Christian guilt and Romantic self-consciousness by surrendering to the primeval dominatrix.
- In "Laus Veneris," men are dispensable, their blood running round the roots of time like rain. They are divided vein by vein by Venus, who divides them "vein by vein."

**Swinburne's Reputation and Works:**
- Swinburne made his reputation with the verse-play "Atalanta in Calydon," displaying his signature cast of sexual personae.
- In this work, Atalanta is Artemis under another name, Althaea combines Clytemnestra and Furies, and Meleager loses to an impossible choice between mother and lover.
- Swinburne's version of the Oresteia recasts Aeschylus in Late Romantic terms with Apollo replaced by his twin sister Atalanta.

**Swinburne's Influences:**
- Swinburne was inspired by Ovid but influenced by Spenser, using the Meleager legend to revise Aeschylus' "Atalanta in Calydon."
- The play combines chthonian intuition with Greek visionary aestheticism and features Atalanta's swiftness or masculine mobility.

#### "Maternal Possession and Androgyny in Swinburne's 'Atalanta in Calydon'"

**Impact of Woman's Advance on Man's Regression (Atalanta in Calydon)**
* Meleager's mother, Althaea, denounces Atalanta as an armed woman who makes war upon herself
* Camouflaged in sex war, Althaea's resentments run deeper; she sees motherhood as possession and possession as law
* Althaea concedes Atalanta's sexual uncanniness, calling her a "strange woman," a "flower," a "sword," red from spilt blood
* These vivid images are self-projections of Althaea's chthonian nature
* Atalanta is both flower and sword, the angel blocking the way to the garden; genital duality recalls Rosalind (rose/prick)
* Althaea reshapes Atalanta in her own image: a carnivorous flower like Huysmans' vaginal blooms
* Subordinates hero to Apollonian and chthonian androgynes, cornering him in sexual cul-de-sac
* In Greek legend, Meleager's mother guards his life term; Swinburne makes brand man's helpless sexual nature, burning but numbed
* Hercules' phallic club a toy in woman's hands; Althaea bitterly rebukes Meleager for loving someone other than her
* Motherhood and godhead are in league, cosmic conspiracy
* Love is mask, power is reality; mother is met at every turn of life path
* When Althaea kills her son by flinging the brand into fire, she makes audacious proclamation of maternal priority
* Claims she's greater than gods: Eumenides oracle reciting successive owners of Delphi from ancient Earth (Ge) to Olympians
* Fuses Eucharist with Thyestean banquet, repossessing beloved son's body in cauldron of her womb
* Family romance is destiny; Althaea insists all legal and moral rights yield to maternity
* Romantic incest collapses human relationships into primeval unity
* Earth (Sadean nature) returns to drive away Apollo, retaking control
* Goya's parental Titan mutilating prey; Althaea impudently fuses Eucharist with Thyestean banquet
* Climax of Atalanta in Calydon is spectacle of Greek lamentation and ritual exhibitionism, ending in mass pietà
* Meleager's farewell to his mother: "Thou too, the bitter mother and mother-plague"
* Cybele reclaiming epiphenomenon of her son
* Transformation of Baudelaire's gorgeous biblical metaphors in Swinburne's work.

#### "Female Dominance and Masochistic Desire in Late Romantic Poetry: Swinburne's 'The Triumph of Time'"

**Nature's Operations in Late Romantic Poetry**

**Meleager's Funeral Oration**:
- Ends with an intricate appeal to Atalanta to touch him, fasten his eyelids, cover his body, and lie on top of him
- Lets no man say he was "slain through female fingers in his woof of life"
- The fabric of life is spun and torn by the fingers of female Fates

**Meleager's Wish for Atalanta**:
- Consummation by suffocation: the bride as bridler
- Meleager demands a ceremony of investiture, the bride as wooer
- Atalanta's veil becomes Aeschylus' net, a shroud to wrap her wooer
- Her covering gesture is transvestite, like the Amazon spreading her coat on Wilhelm Meister

**Meleager's Request of Atalanta**:
- As in Poe, physical contact possible only when one lover is dead or dying
- The intense eroticism of Swinburne's finale is based on hieratic manipulation of the body induced by male from female
- But not achieved, as Atalanta rejects Meleager's requests and rushes offstage

**Meleager's Passive Body**:
- Becomes a quivering membrane of sexual stasis, a jelly adrift in a female sea
- Shifts his hero into the female condition, finds a language of passive aggression
- Poetry flames with vitality but is always the burning brand on the verge of extinction

**Swinburne's Ode to the Sea**:
- Personifies the sea as the mother goddess, the primeval matrix and site of human origins
- Dissolution is rape and purification, an eternal cycle of daemonic redemption
- Sexual union is impersonal, obliterating human identity
- Eroticizes death-by-drowning, a Liebestod or English love-death

**Swinburne's Masochism**:
- Recreational whippings connected to his poetic cosmology, restoring the Great Mother to power
- Self-flagellation was intrinsic to the ancient mother-cults
- Surrendering himself to whipping, Swinburne formalized hierarchical sexual relations
- The hierarchy of female over male is the spiritual principle of Swinburne's poetry

#### "A Reexamination of Algernon Charles Swinburne's 'Anactoria': Unpacking the Influence of Baudelaire and Themes of Love, Power, and Sadism"

**Anactoria: A Poem by Algernon Charles Swinburne**

**Background:**
- Anactoria is a poem that showcases Swinburne's indebtedness to Baudelaire and his exploration of Sappho's themes.
- The poem was inspired by two of Sappho's fragments: the Aphrodite ode and "He seems to me a god."
- Anactoria is considered one of Swinburne's greatest works and a supreme poem of the century.

**Structure:**
- Claustrophobic lesbian scene widens to an enormous wasteland world.
- Consists of three parts: a love poem of lesbian sadism, a portrait of God as a sadist and universe as cold mechanism, and a manifesto of Sappho's immortality as a poet.

**Content:**
1. **Ambivalent Love**: From the first line, love is shown to be deeply ambivalent.
2. **Love vs. Connection**: Love in Swinburne leads not to emotional union and social bonding but renewed distance.
3. **Cannibalism and Consummation**: Sappho's hostility towards Anactoria stems from her need to conquer division by inflicting pain and then consuming the beloved, literally assimilating their identity.
4. **Eye-Object Relations**: Anactoria departs from Swinburne's other poems in its Late Romantic concern with eye-object relations. Sappho protests her subordination to Anactoria's beauty and acts as nature's representative, spreading rapacity throughout the physical world.
5. **The Daemon Rushing In**: Swinburne makes poetry into the brute will-to-power, a Sadean rather than Rousseauist art form, inspired by Blake's Songs of Innocence and Balzac's The Girl with the Golden Eyes. Anactoria's sensuous vulnerability inspires her lover with a virtuosity of sadomasochistic language, envisioning "pain made perfect."

#### "Sappho's Transformative Desire: A Study on Swinburne's Anactoria"

**Anactoria's Body and Sexuality**

**Orphic Lyre**: Anactoria's body is an Orphic lyre played by the Lesbian poet, who makes music from her sobs and poetry from her pain.

**Perfection and Asceticism**: The word "perfect" recurs as the goal of ancient Mysteries with their stages of ritual initiation. Swinburne sees sexual experience as spiritual striving and religious illumination, which is overtly ascetic.

**Swinburne's Poetry**: Sexuality becomes epistemology in Swinburne's poetry, showing a quest for undiscovered sins and untried tortures. The mind yields to the flesh, with action and experience shrinking to the body's parameters.

**Dolores**: Like the sexual preceptress of Kundalini yoga, Dolores reflects the modern era's detachment of sex from society. Swinburne's universe is ruled by negation, with love seen as terminal surgery and illicit knowledge that kills.

**Anactoria's Poetry**: Anactoria's poetry shows sadism permeating the whole universe, with a daemonic nature ruled by a cruel God. The third part is a meditation on the Romantic self, asserting Sappho's poetic vocation and identity.

**Identity and Immortality**: Sappho's maleness is invested in her self-created poetic identity, triumphantly escaping into eternal life through artistic immortality. Swinburne's vampire Sappho invades the reader's space, seeking to defeat God and time by gorging herself on life energy.

#### "Swinburne's Transformation: The Feminine Muse and the Androgynous Poetic Process"

**Anactoria:**
- Poem by Algernon Charles Swinburne, inspired by Sappho's poetry
- Blots out masculine tradition between himself and ancient Greek poet Sappho
- Sexual metathesis: transsexual transformation into Anactoria, passive receptor of Sappho’s advances
- Poetic perfection through unconditional surrender of gender
- Oratory is dignified and restrained without shrillness found in male voices
- Allegory of Swinburne's creative process, pain-music wrung from him through female control

**Anactoria vs. Sappho:**
- Title taken from Swinburne's own sex-crossing persona rather than Anactoria herself
- Invisible in the poem, never named or speaking
- Compared to mute Christabel under vampire’s spell
- Sexual metathesis solves problem of her invisibility as author veiled at center stage.

**Fragoletta:**
- Addresses Henri de Latouche's bisexual and transvestite heroine
- Hermaphroditic beauty with mute, passive, and sensually blank personality
- Perverse adolescent with languid petulance of an autistic child
- Debilitation belongs to civilization in its apathetic late phase.

**Hermaphroditus:**
- Companion piece to "Fragoletta" meditating on Hellenistic statue of the "Sleeping Hermaphrodite"
- Swinburne's Hermaphrodite suffers Late Romantic introversion or self-stifling
- Spiritually impacted, a pod straining with imprisoned abundance
- Nature's phases of germination and efflorescence have stalled.

**Swinburne’s Critique of Heterosexuality:**
- Clever and disarming critique of heterosexuality as the measure of all things but common as household dust
- Hermaphrodite represents ideal beauty, exiled from social dialogue by its static doubleness
- Swinburne's androgynes are Romantic shadows of evolutionary nostalgia, longing for nonbeing.

#### "Sexuality, Decadence, and the Aesthetic Imagination in Victorian Literature: Swinburne and Pater"

**Swinburne's Poetry and Victorian Personae**
- Swinburne's poetry is an "insurrection of language" and a sexual "heterocosm"
- He asserts the primitive and daemonic character of emotion, sex, and nature
- Sexual sadomasochism is always subliminally archaizing, seen in Swinburne's ritual flagellation
- Swinburne longed for decline and believed in "compulsion" rather than free will
- His poetry recreates the primitive world where human life was dictated by brute rhythms of chthonian nature

**Pater vs. Swinburne on Perception and Style**
- Pater adopted Gautier's ideal of literary style as Romantic persona
- He took Swinburne's suspension of English syntax to a Decadent extreme, with long errant sentences
- Gautier needed a polemical preface to neutralize social/moral limitations on art; Pater did it through style alone
- Swinburne was ruled by sexual hierarchies and energized by daemonic nature; Pater's writing had the "ultimate in Decadent lassitude and closure"
- There was no sex or emotion in Pater; he perfected Romantic solipsism
- Pater's prose was passive and deactivated language, while Swinburne's poetry was full of daemonic energy

**Pater's Impact on the Mauve Decade**
- Pater's "Conclusion" from Studies in the History of the Renaissance had a tremendous impact on the 1890s
- He feared it might mislead young men into sexual hedonism, but his real concern was opposing masculine achievement in the imperialist culture
- There are Buddhist parallels with Pater's seeking to be rather than strive, but the analogy breaks down when comparing his writing to the more buoyant Centuries of Thomas Traherne.

#### "The Isolated Self: Walter Pater's Aestheticism and its Limits"

**Pater's Writing and Influence:**
- Emotional repression and inhibited movement in his work
- Subtle "Mannerist sinuosity" in sentences, obscuring visible truths
- Distress at misreadings of "Conclusion," feared action due to preserving spiritual identity
- Reality seen as "impressions unstable, flickering, inconsistent"
- Isolated individuals keep "solitary prisoner their own dream of a world"

**Pater's Limitations and Criticism:**
- Cannot exalt direct experience while insisting on imprisoned self
- Celebrates aesthetic perception in "Conclusion," but objects are merely objects
- Values susceptibility, feminine receptivity, and reflective consciousness
- Personal response is everything; personality is undefined temperament
- Art has no content; form takes precedence over morality
- Influenced by Orientalism and French Impressionist composers like Debussy
- Divisive figure: heterosexual men detested him while homosexual men were drawn to him.

**Pater's Impact on Literature:**
- Woolf, Proust, Moore lauded his work as the "final exquisite flower of Pater’s doctrine'
- Inspired fluid imaginative movement but nauseated by physiology
- Managed to make objects less real in context, contradicting authentic vision.

#### "Pater's Paradoxical Perception: The Aesthete's Struggle with Mother Nature in 'Marius'"

**Marius**
- Completely lacks energy, overpoweringly effete
- Beautiful, grave, and austere but Decadent with enervation
- Pater's contemporaries felt this immediately
- Max Beerbohm recalls his student reaction to Pater: "even then I was angry that he should treat English as a dead language, bored by that sedulous ritual wherewith he laid out every sentence as in a shroud"
- Moore says the language in Marius lies in state
- Pater makes English a Decadent corpse to make love to
- Something is amiss between Paterian theory and practice

**Mechanics of Perception**
- "Experience seems to bury us under a flood of external objects, pressing upon us with a sharp and importunate reality"
- Reflection magically dissolves the "cohesive force" of things: "Each object is loosed into a group of impressions—colour, odour, texture—in the mind of the observer"
- Gautier distances the modern world's excess phenomena by seeing, fixing, and recording an astonishing exactitude of detail
- Pater's loosed impressions are a Decadent disintegration
- He wants to make objects transparent and weightless, like serum
- His Heracleitean theory of universal mobility is actually a defense against the opacity of things, specifically female nature
- Even as he declares objects aerated or liquefied by perception, their weight is so great that he is immobilized
- This invisible weight is what vexed Pater's first readers into metaphors of shroud and funeral

**Aesthetic Perception vs. Female Nature**
- Pater refines the eye and blurs its focus
- An aesthete lives by the eye, a process of Apollonian objectification begun in Egypt
- Pater is trapped in an uncomfortable intermediate state
- His Apollonian transformation of nature is incomplete
- Taking refuge in Heracleitus does not solve his metaphysical problem
- The self cannot be a prison if all things flow
- Pater's persona is as static as Baudelaire's, but Baudelaire projects petrifaction, not fluidity as the optimal condition of the aesthete's universe

**The Mona Lisa Meditation**
- Pater's meditation on Leonardo's Mona Lisa is a "spectacular vision of Decadent Dame Nature"
- She is mother nature as perceptual oppression, blocking the object-world with her exhausting omnipresence
- Appealing to Heracleitus, Pater wants perception without a frame, in the eastern way
- But here he tries to frame Mona Lisa in a moment of hermaphrodite epiphany
- She twists and turns, snaking through history
- Pater fuses Gautier's Mona Lisa with Swinburne's Dolores and Faustine, criminal voluptuaries metamorphosing from era to era
- Mona Lisa is a sexual catchall, civilization's storm-sewer, a prowling promiscuous Clodia
- Pater has no erotic interest in his titanic vampire, his sublimated tastes are exclusively male
- The only sexual or crypto-sexual event is the climax of Marius, where the hero sacrifices his life for a male friend

**Yeats's Response to Pater**
- Yeats endorsed Pater's lyricism by excerpting the Mona Lisa section and printing it as the first modern poem in the Oxford Book of Modern Verse
- But he broke the sentences into lame free verse, destroying their discreet rhythm
- His preface says the passage "dominated a generation"
- Yeats owed a great deal to Pater, adopting the sexual syncretism of Swinburne's vampires
- But Yeats makes a crucial sexual revision, inspired by his own anxieties

#### "Decoding the Enigmatic Allure of Pater's Mona Lisa: A Journey Through Decadence and Transformation"

**Mona Lisa as a Presence in Pater's Imagination:**
- Mona Lisa gives birth to phenomena by parthenogenesis, no need for a partner
- "Leda and the Swan" was a ritual of exorcism for Yeats to free himself from Pater, Decadence, and sexual servitude dreams
- Mona Lisa is shapeless and genderless, takes human form secondarily
- Older than rocks as she created them at the Darwinian dawn of species
- Inhabits a cold mineral realm like Baudelaire's vampires
- Her beauty is mineralized cell deposit of perverse thoughts
- Fabricates herself by coral accretion, incrementation of Decadent parts
- Dreamy autoeroticism like Blake's impacted "Sick Rose"
- Slow gathering of strange thoughts and maladies into her face reappears in Wilde's Dorian Gray
- Simultaneously primeval and Decadent, Alpha and Omega
- Sets world into motion while registering its fatigue in sultry eyelids
- Divine immanence demonstrated through inquisitional ways
- Recalling Gautier's King Candaules, possibly a diver seeking a perfect pearl or a lesbian adventuress

**Mona Lisa as a Traveling Jack-of-all-Trades:**
- Transmigrating Mona Lisa is a male merchant of strange webs and deep seas diver
- Far-flung vocations demonstrate her divine immanence
- Recalling Gautier's King Candaules, possibly the daemonic vampire eye or a lesbian adventuress diving for a female pearl.

### Chapter 19 Apollo Daemonized: Decadent Art

**Pater's Personae and Nature**
- Two sexual personae in Pater: passive male aesthete and his antagonist, mother nature
- Mother nature is summoned once due to her perceptual threat to celibate Pater
- Longest running show in history, Mona Lisa passage is in Swinburne's Hollywood style
- Pater is crucial figure in eye-intense western tradition, focuses on perceptual relations
- Demonstrates monasticism and religiosity in aestheticism and Decadence
- Uses Heracleitus to dissolve solid flesh of archaic Venus, clarifies chthonian nature through Decadent connoisseurship

**Decadence and Androgyny**
- Decadent sexual personae crowd literature and art in late 19th century
- Era of the Androgyne proclaimed as solution but not the answer to all human issues
- H.G. Wells' "The Time Machine" depicts dangerous collective androgyny
- Modernist culture heroes overemphasized, Decadent art overlooked in textbooks
- Revival of figurative painting in last 20 years, need for revision of art history

**Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood**
- Founded in 1848 and lasted only five years
- Sought to recover medieval simplicity lost in pagan luxury of High Renaissance art
- Inspired by Ruskin, professed collective social values
- Only member identified as Decadent is Rossetti due to Italian blood
- Tension between form and moral content in Pre-Raphaelite painting
- Disturbing avoidance of pictorial focus, forced wandering eye
- Landscape has unnatural stillness, sunlit panoramas locked in Decadent closure
- Persons and things are candied, mummified, miniaturized.

#### "The Obsessive Fixation of Dante Gabriel Rossetti: A Study on Women, Art, and Decadence"

**Pre-Raphaelite Art and Dante Gabriel Rossetti**

**Apollonian Objectification**:
- Pre-Raphaelite sharpness of detail is polemically Apollonian
- Mummification is Apollonian objectification and fixation, which Rossetti makes his master principle of sexual personae

**Rossetti's Painting Style**:
- Had trouble painting landscape from nature and sometimes had to recreate it imaginatively
- Paintings obsessively returned to a single subject: a woman of somnambulistic languor
- Rossetti woman rebels against Victorian convention, with unpinned hair and unstructured medieval gown
- Heavy head sways on serpentine neck
- Long thick hair is the Belle Dame Sans Merci's net of entrapment
- Swollen lips are a universal motif of Decadent art

**Elizabeth Siddal**:
- Melancholic consumptive who died of laudanum overdose shortly after Rossetti married her
- Seven years later, Rossetti exhumed her corpse to rescue the sheaf of poems he had buried with her
- Constantly drew and painted Siddal before and after her death
- Friend Ford Madox Brown: "It is like a monomania with him"
- Millais' Ophelia was the most faithful likeness of Siddal, but Siddal herself didn't look like Rossetti's paintings

**Obsession and Reality Deformation**:
- Obsession is psychic closure, a Decadent deforming of reality
- What in Siddal evoked Rossetti's fanatical devotion? Her frailty seemed feminine to others
- Rossetti saw the hermaphrodite remoteness of the beautiful boy, the cruel perfection of solipsistic beauty
- From Siddal came the definitive sexual persona of all Decadent art

**Romantic Regression and Chiaroscuro**:
- Rossetti's painting began to drift from Pre-Raphaelite Middle Ages toward pagan past, a Romantic regression
- Chiaroscuro, banished from early Pre-Raphaelitism, returned to cloud heart and mind
- Symons sees the sinister transformation of Rossetti's women into "idols"
- Venus grows "more and more Asiatic"; dreams become "lunar, spectral, a dark and unintelligible menace"

**Objets de Culte and Allegorical Repletion**:
- Gradually fleshes out skinny Elizabeth Siddal with post-Raphaelite Baroque massiness
- Fills in Romanticism's lack of sculpture by giving female personae a sculptural density
- Most blatant objets de culte: Astarte Syriaca
- Chiaroscuro, banished from early Pre-Raphaelitism, has returned to cloud heart and mind
- Allegorical repletion, my term for Leonardo's The Virgin and Child with St. Anne

**Psychic Fragmentation and Late Romantic Materiality**:
- Psyche fragments into female plurals: the masochistic self-haunting of a Romantic sister-spirit
- Exert ominous power across a dead space of Late Romantic materiality
- Repeats the same face thrice in Rosa Triplex and La Ghirlandata
- Beata Beatrix: Dead Elizabeth Siddal, a clairvoyant Beatrice, prays to the divinized idea of herself with closed eyes
- Decadence is about dead ends.

#### "Exploring the Decadent Aesthetics and Sexuality in Burne-Jones' Art Nouveau"

**Medievalism in Late Period Rossetti and Burne-Jones**

**Dante's Influence on Rossetti and Burne-Jones**:
- Rossetti retains Dante's grandiose cultism of dead Beatrice
- In Vita Nuova, Dante subordinates himself to a coolly narcissistic female adolescent
- Burne-Jones ritualizes sex through western art

**Burne-Jones and Rossetti's Personae**:
- Burne-Jones' pensive Sir Galahad is obviously Siddal as equestrian knight
- Burne-Jones' youthful Pygmalion has the same face as the girl of Danaë
- Burne-Jones' lovers of Cupid and Psyche are mirror-images
- Burne-Jones' faces exhibit "unique" rings under the eyes, described as a result of masturbation, lesbianism, normal love-making, or tuberculosis
- These harrowing black eyes come from the sickly Siddal

**Burne-Jones' Transsexual World**:
- Burne-Jones' personae are one incestuously self-propagating being

- Their personae are radically despiritualized, efflorescences not of psyche but of couture

**Emotion vs. Form**
- Emotion is nothing, the public impression everything
- The religion of form, as upheld by Lady Bracknell, has a liturgy fixed by fashion
- The body is self-sculpted at the whim of fashion, with the human figure being merely decorative
- Cake and sugar are items of décor, marks of caste, irrelevant to taste

**Gwendolen's Isolationism in High Comedy**

#### "Whitman's Androgynous Cosmos: A Study of Masculinity and Femininity in Leaves of Grass"

**The Influence of Hermaphroditic and Masculine Personas in Literature**

**Whitman's Poetry**:
- Whitman's poetry is inspired by his identification with the Great Mother, which results in him overemphasizing his masculinity to retain his sex in the surging female nature of his poetry.
- The pseudomale persona of Whitman would "pop like a birthday balloon."
- Swinburne, whose sensuous ocean mother was inspired by Whitman's, has no sexual anxiety and welcomes male subordination to woman.
- Whitman cannot escape his proletarian past where a man is a man by labor and robustness, leading to the "tiresome rattling of an imaginary saber" in his poetry.
- Whitman honors both the mother of men and women, but heterosexual desire remains mimed and voyeuristic in his work.

**Sexual Themes in Whitman's Poetry**:
- The real eroticism goes toward athletic males in Iliadic spectacles of pleasure-pain.
- Voyeuristic Whitman luxuriates in the red rents made in a white male beauty, combining scenes from Homer's heroes and Odysseus' battering against the sea cliff.
- The companion passage is a fantasy of the male heroine I cited vis-à-vis Swinburne: "I am the mash’d fireman with breast-bone broken."
- This scene is a Late Romantic pietà, with Whitman the ritually slain son of the all-mother.
- Desire is homosexual for the same reason the penis stays soft: the physical impossibility of mating with the Great Mother, mountainous as Baudelaire's giantess.

**Comparison to Other Literary Figures**:
- Like Swinburne, union is not genital but oral in Whitman's poetry.
- Whitman consumes his object-world, just as he is consumed by it.
- His poetic style is sexual litany, long pulses of invocation readying the self for invasion by the world-mother who is the world-matter.
- James criticism is too adulatory, resulting in the academic censoring of his fantastically perverse imagination.
- The last novels of Henry James belong to the fin de siècle and are encumbered with Alexandrian ornamentation, reflecting his covert Romanticism and sex reversals.

- Basil, as the virile hero, is more explicit than in other James novels
- The lesbianism in The Bostonians is more explicit than in any other novel

**Hawthorne's Transmission of Coleridgean Psychology**:
- Hawthorne, like Poe, transmits Coleridge's daemonic psychology of sex and power to James
- The social novel is predicated on control or exclusion of the sexual archetypal
- The sequence Coleridge, Hawthorne, James parallels Balzac, Baudelaire, Swinburne as a line of descent of lesbian erotica

**James's Heroines and Transsexual Identification**:
- Edmund Wilson sees transsexual identification in all James's heroines
- James's interest in "immature girls who are objects of desire or defilement" came from a polarization with his brother William
- There was always an innocent little girl whom he cherished and loved, but later tried to violate and even kill

**The Turn of the Screw**:
- The governess invades the Arcadia of a Jane Austen country house, disrupting it with Poe's obsessive eroticism

#### "Exploring the Visual Tyranny and Decadent Eroticism in Henry James's 'The Turn of the Screw'"

**The Vampire and Hierarchical Assertion in The Turn of the Screw**
- The vampire, through sudden hierarchical assertion, projects the "white leprosy of time"
- Quint and Jessel exist as nodes of visibility, not characters, in a novelistic sense
- They are hieratic personae in a cult of the western eye
- The "womb-tombs of the Gothic tale of terror" empty into the story's appalling open spaces with violent sightlines
- James demonstrates the aggression in the act of western seeing, binding person to person in Euclidean triangles
- Quint and Jessel's opacity comes from their intensity of seeing and being seen, which "withers" them like Wordsworth's solitaries or Baudelaire's crucified poet
- They are points of negative cathexis, reverse images of the entrancing art-object hierarchs in Sarrasine and Dorian Gray
- What is Decadent in Quint and Jessel is their visual concentration and immobility, their horrifying stillness
- They are Coleridgean saboteurs in Wordsworthian nature, have the gravity of Emerson's eyeball, and the density of Balzac's black diamond
- Eroticism in The Turn of the Screw takes the frigid form of voyeurism, with Quint and Jessel practicing shamanistic transportation of consciousness
- This is a modern magic produced by Rousseau's unstable fusion of sexuality and identity
- The governess' psychic space is invaded by eye-potent spectres, who are torn between heaven and hell
- The governess imposes a Manichaean duality on the children, making her a Decadent artist joining moral and aesthetic extremes
- The screw of the title belongs to a spinster with a screw loose or the nail of excess mental control, splitting society's hierarchical frame
- Turning the screw in a vortex or maelstrom of pleasure-pain, the governess makes love to and fertilizes herself
- The governess' supreme achievement is the death-by-imagination of the terrorized boy-child Miles
- The governess is the stepmother of fatal embrace, similar to the witch-queen in Snow White
- Quint at the window may recall Catherine's ghost at the window in Wuthering Heights, and Jessel descends from Coleridge's Geraldine
- The Turn of the Screw is rich in Romantic archetypes, with Quint and Jessel as dark counterparts to Poe's Usher and Hawthorne's Zenobia

- Violence is her love song and lullaby

**Emily Dickinson's Rough Speech**

**Dickinson's Metaphors**:
- Depicted herself in a garish tableau of late-Renaissance theatricality, like a Bernini papal tomb
- Posing on the steps like a Dickens waif holding out her tin cup
- Behind the metaphor may be Hamlet's singing gravedigger or George Herbert's "Church-monuments"
- Dickinson as a tiny scholar emerging from ghastly lessons and bursting into song

**Dickinson vs. James**:
- Swinburne's alliterations and incantatory rhythms are primitivizing devices, returning poetry to its origins in religious ritual
- In Dickinson, it is not rhythm but image that is regressive
- She uses metaphors more literally than anyone else in major literature
- Her lurid concretization is her mode of Late Romantic materiality

**Dickinson's Poetic Style**:
- Dickinson's sentimental feminine poems remain neglected by embarrassed scholars
- The mawkish poems are designed to dovetail with those of violence and suffering
- Singsong rhythms and neat rhymes are spurious in Dickinson, the first modernist master of syncopation and atonality

- Death, not a Redeemer, waits at the top of the stairway to heaven

**Dickinson's Personae**:

- The sentimental poems are feminine personae, representing a primary response to nature, glad and trusting
- The sadomasochistic poems are Sadean, representing the violent metaphors
- Dickinson accepts femininity but denies femaleness, sweeping it out of her cosmos

#### "Exploring Gender and Identity in Emily Dickinson's Poetry: The Masculine and Monumental 'I'"

**Thesis:** Emily Dickinson's poetry reflects her exploration of gender through various representational styles and transsexual titles, using masculine identifiers as a technique for self-desexing or hermaphrodization in her poems about colossal monumentality and sadomasochistic metaphors.

**Representational Styles:**
1. Rococo: feminine persona of Wordsworthian or Emersonian credulity toward nature (296)
2. Monumentality: masculinizing style, inspired by Blake and late Italian Renaissance art (666)
3. Sadistic Poems: technique of self-hermaphrodization through emptying out female internality

**Gender Identifiers:**
1. Boy, man, bachelor, brother, uncle
2. Czar, earl, prince, duke, emperor (unconnected with territorial jurisdiction)
3. Girl, dull girl, earl's face
4. Exeter: God or afterlife
5. Skill to hold her brow like an Earl (473)
6. Bourbon: ominous implication of immortality

**Transsexual Titles:**
1. Dickinson: proud manly title used in six letters to Higginson
2. Czar and Woman simultaneously: chimera of gender
3. Earl: emptied of territorial jurisdiction, a joke at the expense of a diminished God or self-awarded title
4. Duke of Exeter: probably God or afterlife
5. Bourbon: ascend the guillotine

**Significance:**
Emily Dickinson's poetry reflects her exploration of gender through various representational styles and transsexual titles, using masculine identifiers as a technique for self-desexing or hermaphrodization in her poems about colossal monumentality and sadomasochistic metaphors. Her royal titles are honorary degrees of extremity, marking advance into the afterlife, and reflect her confusion between feminine and masculine roles in society and spiritual evolution.

**Wilson Knight's Claims:**
- Preference for death by tiger over boa constrictor or octopus

- Invasion of the poet's inner self, room of one's own
- Autotomy: poet sheds male persona, materialization of her own phallic potency
- Demonic and daemonic snake as interference from unconscious
- Sadistic principal drives feminine persona out in "The Worm"
- Influences: Byron's Manfred, Shakespeare's Cleopatra, Christabel

**Gun Metaphor:**
- Loaded gun metaphor is hermaphroditic due to sexual metathesis and synthesis of action and reaction.

#### "Exploring the Masculine and Feminine Symbolism in Emily Dickinson's Poetry of Death and Transformation"

**Dickinson's Poetic Themes and Imagery**

**Binary Trope**:
- Dickinson's poem "He found my Being" uses a binary trope of immobility and travel limitation
- She sees herself as a toppled gravestone or cromlech, claimed by a vagabond male (probably the bridegroom Jesus)

**Limited Travel vs. Immobility**:
- Limited travel has become immobility in the psychodrama of the poem

**Passivity and Sexuality**:
- Dickinson's poetic persona is a passive phallic monument, both masculine and feminine
- Her "Columnar Self" stands on a "Granitic Base"
- She thinks of obelisks in the town cemetery as "Shafts of Granite" with an "Age—and Name / And perhaps a phrase in Egyptian"

**Death as Enforced Passivity**:
- Dickinson sees death as enforced passivity, an agonizing impediment of movement
- The dying person becomes a thing, like a corpse labeled like a mummy in a museum
- Dickinson's notorious preoccupation with death is a hermaphrodizing obsession, a Romantic motif in its Decadent late phase

**Femininity and Sexuality**:
- A dead female is a frozen phallic shaft; a dead male is a felled tree of humiliating inertness
- Death makes sterile androgynes, as corpse is a manufactured object, an android
- Dickinson's poetry is sexual scripts, like Sade's, where God condemns man to fascist oppression and sexual subordination

**Nature and Personae**:
- Dickinson thinks in theatrical or masquelike terms, writing capsule screenplays of agony and ecstasy
- Her usual style is gruesome Sadean comedy, where nature's beauty is cruel because transient
- Humanity's Wordsworthian illusions about nature are always being sabotaged in her poetry

#### "Exploring Emily Dickinson's Dark and Sadomasochistic Vision of Nature and God"

**Dickinson's Vision of Nature and God**

**Soundtracks of Destruction:**
- Dickinson composes music with themes of cruelty and execution (cf. "The Awful Cutlery" and "The Man to die tomorrow / Harks for the Meadow Bird")
- Nature's pretty sounds incite violent impulses, such as the ax ringing like a scaffold (708) or pianos playing louder than dueling banjos (348)

**Metaphors of Destruction:**
- Dickinson sees natural elements and objects as destructive forces: snow and wind are "Brooms of Steel," moon is "like a Head a Guillotine," sea is "An Everywhere of Silver With Ropes of Sand" (1252, 629, 884)
- The poet describes a world governed by sadomasochistic extremes ("A Wounded Deer leaps highest," "The Smitten Rock gushes," "the trampled Steel springs")

**God as Jealous and Vindictive:**
- Dickinson views God as a jealous and vindictive being who lures mankind into the grave (301)
- She sees life as a balance between pleasure and pain ("In keen and quivering ratio"), with God's sadism determining the poet's own metaphors

**Irreverence Towards Christ:**
- Dickinson expresses cynical and irreverent views towards Christ, comparing her own crosses to others at Calvary (561)
- She notes the "fashions" of the Cross and is fascinated by its usage. Is she a bystander or a pedestrian observing an Easter parade?

#### "Exploring Emily Dickinson's Unconventional Explorations of Faith, Body, and Power"

**Emily Dickinson's Unorthodox Thought Processes**
- Her unconventional train of thought may have been started by the episode of Veronica's veil, where Christ was adorned with a woman's chador
- Dickinson saw Christ as misrepresented in his testament, like a wolfish divine face hidden within flowery nature
- The body is seen as Poe's Red Death and shrinking torture cell, with the netting of veins and arteries like chicken wire bars on doors and windows
- What is "mine" is the certainty of extinction, represented by the bright sign in the scarlet prison that cannot be concealed
- Dickinson sees life as imitating Christ, with the body extending us onto the cross of Blake's tree of nature
- Consciousness takes the form of a body tormented in every limb, like Blake's Universal Man hammering on himself
- Sadomasochism is seen as a limitation of the will and reduction of self, rather than just aggression towards others
- A feminist critique might see Dickinson hemmed in by respectability and paternalism, but Romantic poets were struggling with the absence of limits
- Dickinson's most uncontrolled encounter is with the serpent of her antisocial self, which breaks out like the Aeolian winds
- She wages guerrilla warfare with society through fractures, cripplings, impalements, and amputations that demolish Victorian proprieties
- Her love of the apocalyptic parallels Decadent European taste for salon paintings of the fall of Babylon or Rome
- Dickinson's sadomasochistic metaphors are not anger but hostility, an a priori intolerance for others that is the female version of Romantic solipsism
- Women have been discouraged from certain genres due to societal expectations, but even without restrictions there would be few female Pascal, Milton, or Kant
- Genius will overcome, but men's egotism and culture invention are sources of their greatness as a sex
- Dickinson converts every reverse into an impulse to create, with her poems registering nature's surges of animating energy in abrupt and traumatic changes.

#### "Exploring Emily Dickinson's Dark Romanticism: Amputations, Despair, and Intergalactic Nothingness"

**Dickinson's Hypochondria and Metaphors**
- Dickinson's hypochondria takes two forms: anxiety about internal disease and obsession with loss of limbs
- Less serious form is anxiety, more pathological is obsession with amputations (e.g., her mother's hand and foot leaving her)
- Amputations are like Kleist's mastectomies: brutal self-reduction as restocking of nature's organ bank
- Hypochondria may be castration anxiety for a hermaphrodite poet, as seen in her detachment from phallic genius loci
- Dickinson shows little concern with disease, instead focusing on piercings, slashings, hackings, scorchings, and dislocations
- Poe's Red Death and Baudelaire's Voyage to Cythera use disease as major Late Romantic metaphor for chthonian femaleness
- Dickinson substitutes accidents for disease, part of her effort to wipe out chthonian femaleness in nature

**Dickinson's Modern Metaphors and Perspective**
- Dickinson's vision of intergalactic nothingness is a leap into modern metaphor, prophetic of science fiction
- Her lead boots are identified with moon landings by her true contemporaries
- Lonely plunge into Pascal's abyss is the severest thought for any premodern woman writer
- Dickinson anticipates Kafka in combining emptiness and absurdity with tyrannical authority
- Her modern ice world is a result of her Brontëan swerve from gender, refusing femaleness in herself or nature
- Science fiction's glacial wastes are a landscape without maternal procreation, a poetic anorexia or willed starvation

**Dickinson vs. Whitman: Rhetorical Forms and Perspective on Self**
- Dickinson's small lyrics are a sexual closure, consolidating ego, while Whitman extends himself outward for impregnation
- Dickinson chooses one because the self must be sealed up and its integrity defended, unlike Austen's provincial life
- Her poems are Apollonian cells of individuation, contrasting with Baudelaire's corrupted entities as projections of a diseased body.

#### "Exploring Emily Dickinson's Bisexual Poetics: A Study of Masculine and Feminine Personae"

**Dickinson's Poetry: Bisexual Rhetoric and Contraction of Syntax**

**Dickinson's Major Poems**: bursting with hermaphroditic lozenges, a small feminine body charged with a mighty masculine mind
- Language is confined in Dickinson's poetry compared to Whitman and Huysmans' proliferation of vocabulary
- Her poems are imploded, their contours jagged and torn by suction
- She introverts words, doubling them back in puns on their roots
- Ellipsis produces broken metrical accents, a queer lurching rhythm
- Harsh pressures on language are another ritual limitation, returning the Romantic self to governable dimensions from monstrous immensity

**Romanticism and Female Genius**: inherent irony in the idea of female Romantic genius
- Romanticism is an imaginative realignment of western male will toward female powers, which it internalizes
- Elizabeth Barrett Browning and her fellow poetesses' work is weak due to Romanticism being a sex-crossing mode that adds femaleness to maleness
- Femaleness added to femaleness is a Romantic redundancy, the Muse will make no visitation
- Brontë and Dickinson succeed as Romantics because they are women of masculine will who tend toward sadism

**Dickinson's Sadomasochism**: Lacerating self-abuse is her ritual consecration, by which she makes vows to art
- Her sadistic metaphors are among the most grisly in major poetry, injecting synthetic male hormone into a hermaphroditic genre that resists female practitioners

**Dickinson's Sentimentality**: an unexpected union of society with Wordsworthian nature by linking them both to femininity
- Feminine personae are mental calisthenics, dissuading Dickinson from sadism
- They add representational weight to the light end of the sexual seesaw, restoring her poetic equilibrium
- Her feminine personae are mental gymnastics that enable her to maintain muscle tonelessness in prison

**Dickinson's Relationship with Her Mother**: She demotes her real mother from creative authority, using Blake against Wordsworth
- Dickinson and Brontë cultivate the Romantic sister-relation, a denial of ancestral indebtedness
- There are few mothers in Dickinson's nature poetry, nearly all qualified by some irony

#### "Exploring the Dark and Complex Nature of Emily Dickinson's Self-Image and Relationship with Power"

**Emily Dickinson's View of Nature and Her Persona**

**Nature**:
- Not a meadow of green promise but a spectral Gothic chamber
- Rejects fecund ripening for herself as well as her metaphors
- Sees nature as "Haunted House," while art is a "House that tries to be haunted"

**Romantic Art and Dickinson's Work**:
- Romantic art finds the pagan spiritualism in matter
- Dickinson's work has elements of sentimentality, but it is a road away from the mother rather than toward her

**Dickinson's Persona and Writing Style**:
- Dressed in white, never mother or bride
- Boy personae are deflections of maturation, an anorexic suppression of sexual shape
- Writes in perfect consciousness of her secret greatness and power
- Plays with exhibitionism through self-deceptive fictions

**Relationship with "Preceptor" Higginson**:
- Dickinson's veneration of Higginson, a man well-known in his day but now a footnote, is symbolic deference to a lesser intelligence
- Her letters to him are full of plaintiveness and rich with gloating, intimidation cloaked as revelation.

**Dickinson's View on Her Small Size**:
- Refers to herself as "Sparrow," "little Girl," "child," "Wren," "Chestnut Bur," and "Sola sola com’ un’ aiuch’" (alone alone like an owl)
- Appears small and mild, but her eyes aggressively advance on the reader.

**Comparison with a Friend's Coping Mechanism**:
- A friend of Dickinson's, a native Bostonian and paragon of archaic WASP decorum, appears smaller under stress, unlike the Mediterranean principle of raised hackles and emphatic enlargement of personality.

  - Played the role of a child entering her own kingdom of heaven
- Talked nonstop during meetings, draining visitors of their vitality
- Fondness for corpses exceeding Victorian cult of bereavement

#### "The Voyeuristic Gaze of Emily Dickinson: Death and Decadence in Her Letters"

**The Corpse Poems as Glass Coffins**
- Each corpse poem is a glass coffin with the withered beloved on display
- These are the trophies of the belle of Amherst, a Circe who shrinks men with a tap of her wand
- Dickinson makes a mausoleum out of a bedchamber
- Her men are living dolls, like Rachilde's Raoule de Vénérande
- They are manufactured objects, a romance of prosthetics

**Death as an Object d'Art**
- Death is the black paint in which the poet dips her brush
- The objet d'art lacks prestige in nineteenth-century American culture
- Wellborn James must go to Europe to procure his golden bowl, which is ritually broken within its novel
- Decadent Dickinson makes objets d'art of her loved ones
- For lack of artistic models, she turns them into ice sculptures, corpi delicti of God's crimes

**The Puritan Taboo on Visual Gratification**
- The lingering Puritan taboo on visual gratification inflamed the eye in American Romanticism
- Poe, Hawthorne, Emerson, Whitman, and Dickinson suffer fluctuations between voyeurism and paranoia
- Dickinson flattens her chosen ones by her ocular force
- She drops on them like a hawk, her eye sadistically glittering
- Her Decadent voyeurism is abundantly clear in her letters

**The Letters of Condolence**
- The letters increasingly become a chain of condolences
- Death and calamity are the only subjects on which the poet speaks
- Life is a string of black pearls
- The letters can be in questionable taste
- To a friend whose infant son had an operation: "How is your little Byron? Hope he gains his foot without losing his genius"
- Flattery and tartness queasily mingle
- The poet's honeyed words have a secret sting

**The Poet as Oracle and Ritual Mourner**
- The letters of condolence are deathday rather than birthday gifts, handcrafted by the poet in her secret forge
- The poet injects herself into the mourners' suffering as they confront elemental realities
- She senses death's primitivistic energy, which excites her

**The Poet's Withdrawals and Publicity**
- Dickinson refused to be photographed or receive most callers
- She would not address letters in her own hand and carried on conversations from behind a screen or the next room
- Her aggravating affectations evoked a memorable response from Samuel Bowles: "Emily, you wretch. No more of this nonsense. I've traveled all the way from Springfield to see you. Come down at once."

#### "Exploring Emily Dickinson's Sado-Masochistic Poetic Personae and Themes"

**Fire Bells Incident and Emily Dickinson's Response:**
- Awakened by fire bells in the night, mistaking it for the 4th of July
- Vinnie consoled Emily and led her to mother's room
- Emily was sensitive and childlike even at 48 years old
- Perversity lies in Emily's consent to Vinnie's deception regarding the incident
- Tripling the poet's impersonations through involving the Norcrosses as another audience
- Ambiguous attitudes towards her correspondents: "Are Friends Delight or Pain?"
- Sadomasochistic dialectic governs Dickinson's world and relationships
- Love is an affliction that enervates, with oscillations of attraction and repulsion
- Persona masks her true feelings; real attitude deeply ambivalent towards correspondents.

**Comparison to Madame Butterfly:**
- Both involve complex moments where affection snakes through person after displaced person, gathering pity back towards themselves
- Similar theatrical triangulation of sadomasochistic perception
- Both use reversals in relationships: "He was weak, and I was strong—then"—a wrestling match of domination and submission.

**Dickinson's Letters:**
- Mild personae and endearments are an artifice of courtship
- Her real attitude towards correspondents is deeply ambivalent
- Emotion enervates, wasted on unworthy or indifferent objects
- Pain is mentalized sex, a Decadent specialty
- Sadomasochistic dialectic governs everything: "I rose—because He sank"
- Perpetuates the divinity of her chosen ones by imprisoning them in her mental eye.

**Dickinson's Attitudes Towards Religion:**
- Catholicism for its ritualism, not morality
- A fan, hero-worshipper, and creator of hierarchic preeminence
- Reality is always vulgar; the idea of the beloved superior to actual fact.
- Seclusion is her perceptual weapon against disillusionment.

#### "Exploring Emily Dickinson's Unconventional Relationships and Sexuality"

**Emily Dickinson's Heroine Image and Her Real Life**

**Dickinson as a Heroine**:
- Disappointed in love, she languished alone
- Thought to have had a mysterious heartbreaker (e.g., minister, married man, invalid)
- Poems depicted lovers as dead or in extremis

**Revised View of Dickinson's Poetry and Life**:
- Her poetry showed that men did not deeply impact her imaginative life
- She used equivocations about marriage (e.g., addressing letters only to the wife, using showy euphemisms for "husband")
- Dickinson elided "husband" into "wife" (e.g., mentor reconstituted as a more palatable lover)

**Dickinson's Relationship with Judge Otis P. Lord**:
- Controversial idea of a serious consideration for marriage to Judge Lord
- Dickinson may have exploited Lord for cinematic rematerialization of her father's presence
- Her letters to him were contrived and artificial, written in twittering feminine persona

**Dickinson's Relationship with Susan Gilbert**:
- Best friend before marriage to Austin Dickinson
- Aggressively elided "husband" into "wife"
- Tension grew over the years, with dark, charged ambivalence
- Alleged allusion: "For the Woman whom I prefer, Here is Festival—Where my Hands are cut, Her fingers will be found inside." (implies lesbianism)

**Patterson's Argument on Catherine Scott Anthon**:
- Boldly argued that Anthon drove Dickinson into seclusion with a broken heart
- But misread the poems and ended up as a fuzzy, schmaltzy novelette
- Patterson saw most of Dickinson's males as Anthon in disguise (sexual metathesis)

**Sexual Metathesis in Dickinson's Poetry**:
- Dickinson was more interested in masculinizing herself than masculinizing other women
- Her erotics of Sadean hierarchy required most males to be male, without heterosexual desire on her part
- She was a Wildean Apollonian aroused by rank alone, irrespective of gender

**Dickinson's Lesbian Tendencies**:
- Psychobiographers recognized Dickinson's lesbian tendencies
- But criticism has not assimilated these perceptions into explication of the poetry
- Long conventionalization of Dickinson epitomized in retouching her photograph to make her appear more feminine
